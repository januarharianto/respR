## Developers

`respR` is designed, programmed, and maintained by [**Januar Harianto**](https://github.com/januarharianto) and [**Nicholas Carey**](https://github.com/nicholascarey). We are biologists and wrote the `respR` code to assist with our own work, before realising it would be useful to the scientific community and developing it as an `R` package. We have done this almost entirely in our spare time, spending many hundreds of hours working on it.

## Note

We are at present just trying Discord and Slack out. Which of them we will use going forward will depend on if anyone uses them. It is very likely that we will abandon one or both if there isn't much interest or utility!
