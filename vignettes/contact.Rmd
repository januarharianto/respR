## Developers

`respR` is designed, programmed, and maintained by [**Nicholas Carey**](https://github.com/nicholascarey) and [**Januar Harianto**](https://github.com/januarharianto). We are biologists and wrote the `respR` code to assist with our own work, before realising it would be useful to the scientific community and developing it as an `R` package. We have done this almost entirely in our spare time, spending many hundreds of hours working on it.
