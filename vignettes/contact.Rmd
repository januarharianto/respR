## Developers

`respR` is designed, programmed, and maintained by [**Nicholas Carey**](https://github.com/nicholascarey) and [**Januar Harianto**](https://github.com/januarharianto). We are working biologists and originally wrote the `respR` code to assist with our own respirometry analyses, before realising it would be useful to the scientific community and developing it as an `R` package. We have done this almost entirely in our spare time, spending many hundreds of hours working on it. You can help support ongoing development of the package [**here**](https://januarharianto.github.io/respR/articles/support.html).
