In different habitats, however, the characteristics of these hypoxic events may differ, therefore imposing different challenges. We investigated the tolerance of adult ghost shrimp Neotrypaea uncinata (an intertidal mudflat dweller) to different partial pressures of oxygen (pO2), severe hypoxia (2 kPa) and recovery from hypoxia after different exposure times, mimicking the natural tidal cycle (6 h and 12 h). We calculated critical oxygen tension and categorize the adult ghost shrimps as oxyregulators (R value = 75.27\%). All physiological measurements (metabolic rate, oxyhemocyanin, hemolymph protein and lactate concentrations) were affected by exposure to low partial pressures of oxygen, but most of them recovered (with exception of metabolic rate) control values (21 kPa) after 6 h under normoxic conditions. Low metabolic rate, high release of hemolymphatic proteins and anaerobic metabolism are suggested as response mechanisms to overcome hypoxic events during low tide.},

Rates of CO2 emission (VCO{$\sum$}) increased exponentially to plateau values that were twice as high in P. californicus as P. rugosus on a massspecific basis. VCO{$\sum$} then fell sharply, during which gross motor activity (measured optically) and spiracular control (measured from VCO{$\sum$} variation) abruptly ceased, yielding two independent measures of CTmax. As determined by loss of muscular coordination, the CTmax of Pogonomyrmex rugosus was 51.57{$\pm$}0.38\textdegree C (mean {$\pm$} S.D., while that of Pogonomyrmex californicus was 51.74{$\pm$}0.25\textdegree C. As determined by loss of spiracular control, the CTmax of Pogonomyrmex rugosus was 51.59{$\pm$}0.35\textdegree C, while that of Pogonomyrmex californicus was 51.78{$\pm$}0.37\textdegree C. In each species a pronounced post-mortal peak of VCO{$\sum$} was observed. The major ecological and behavioral differences of the two species are not reflected in their CTmax values, which do not differ significantly. `Thermolimit respirometry' allows CTmax to be estimated objectively with coefficients of variation (S.D./mean) {$<$}1\%, lending confidence to comparisons between species or treatment groups.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, physiologists have estimated the ability of organisms to withstand lower partial pressures of oxygen by estimating the partial pressure at which oxygen consumption begins to decrease (known as the critical PO2 or Pc). For almost 30years, the principal way in which Pc has been estimated has been via piecewise 'broken stick' regression (BSR). BSR was a useful approach when more sophisticated analyses were less available, but BSR makes a number of unsupported assumptions about the underlying form of the relationship between the rate of oxygen consumption and oxygen availability. The BSR approach also distils a range of values into a single point with no estimate of error. In accordance with more general calls to fit functions to continuous data, we propose the use of nonlinear regression (NLR) to fit various curvilinear functions to oxygen consumption data in order to estimate Pc. Importantly, our approach is back-compatible so that estimates using traditional methods in earlier studies can be compared with data estimates from our technique. When we compared the performance of our approach relative to the traditional BSR approach for real world and simulated data, we found that under realistic circumstances, NLR was more accurate and provided more powerful hypothesis tests. We recommend that future studies make use of NLR to estimate Pc, and also suggest that this approach might be more appropriate for a range of physiological studies that use BSR currently.},

PC defines the partial pressure of oxygen (Po2) at which an oxygen regulator switches to a conformer. However, not all animals show such clear patterns in oxygen consumption rate (M\textperiodcentered{} O2), and there are many methods for determining PC. This study assesses two methods that determine regulatory ability and four that calculate PC. A new method, the regulation index (RI), assigns to an animal a relative measure of regulatory ability by calculating the area under the M\textperiodcentered{} O2 versus Po2 curve that is greater than a linear trend. The six methods are applied to developmental M\textperiodcentered{} O2 data of two amphibians, Pseudophryne bibronii and Crinia georgiana. The four methods used to determine PC produced similar results but failed to identify the increase in regulation on hatching in C. georgiana or the greater regulation in larval C. georgiana compared with P. bibronii. Of the two methods that evaluated regulation, only the RI satisfactorily represented the entire range of Po2. The RI is advantageous because it has clearly defined limits and does not constrain data to fit any single pattern. The RI can be used in concert with PC, which can be easily calculated during the RI analysis, to provide a clearer definition of the M\textperiodcentered{} O2 response to environmental Po2.},

This study used a paired design on the marine teleost, red drum. Pcrit is comparable between closed (4.6{$\pm$} 0.2 kPa; mean{$\pm$}s.e.m.) and intermittent flow (4.4{$\pm$}0.2 kPa; mean{$\pm$} s.e.m.) respirometry. pCO2, ammonia and pH changes within the chamber were measured prior to the onset of Pcrit and at the end of a typical Pcrit trial and revealed changes in water chemistry in both closed and intermittent flow. Pcrit values were similar in both methods of hypoxia induction regardless of subsequent water chemistry changes that occurred in both methods.},

Using nonlinear regression fit to an exponential (modified Weibull) function, or linear regression of MO2 versus PO2 at low PO2, and determining Pcrit as the PO2 when MO2 equals standard metabolic rate (SMR) yielded values that were consistent across fish and among experimental trials. The magnitude of the difference in Pcrit determined by alternative calculation methods exceeded the differences determined in closed and intermittent-flow respirometry, highlighting the need to standardize analytical as well as experimental approaches in determining Pcrit.},

  abstract = {The rate of hypoxia induction (RHI) is an important but overlooked dimension of environmental hypoxia that may affect an organism's survival. We hypothesized that, compared with rapid RHI, gradual RHI will afford an organism more time to alter plastic phenotypes associated with O2 uptake and subsequently reduce the critical O2 tension (Pcrit) of the rate of O2 uptake (\.M O2). We investigated this by determining Pcrit values for goldfish exposed to short ({$\sim$}24 min), typical ({$\sim$}84 min) and long ({$\sim$}480 min) duration Pcrit trials to represent different RHIs. Consistent with our predictions, long duration Pcrit trials yielded significantly lower Pcrit values (1.0\textendash 1.4 kPa) than short and typical duration trials, which did not differ (2.6{$\pm$}0.3 and 2.5 {$\pm$}0.2 kPa, respectively). Parallel experiments revealed these timerelated shifts in Pcrit were associated with changes to aspects of the O2 transport cascade that took place over the hypoxia exposures: gill surface areas and haemoglobin\textendash O2 binding affinities were significantly higher in fish exposed to gradual RHIs over 480 min than fish exposed to rapid RHIs over 60 min. Our results also revealed that the choice of respirometric technique (i.e. closed versus intermittent) does not affect Pcrit or routine \.M O2, despite the significantly reduced water pH and elevated CO2 and ammonia levels measured following closed-circuit Pcrit trials of {$\sim$}90 min. Together, our results demonstrate that gradual RHIs result in alterations to physiological parameters that enhance O2 uptake in hypoxic environments. An organism's innate Pcrit is therefore most accurately determined using rapid RHIs ({$<$}90 min) so as to avoid the confounding effects of hypoxic acclimation.},

Stressors can interact in unanticipated ways, where exposure to one stressor may heighten or reduce resilience to another stressor. We examined how a leading threat to aquatic species, nitrate pollution, affects susceptibility to hypoxia and heat stress in a salmonid, the European grayling (Thymallus thymallus). Fish were exposed to nitrate pollution (0, 50 or 200 mg NO3- L-1) at two acclimation temperatures (18 \textdegree C or 22 \textdegree C) for eight weeks. Hypoxia- and heattolerance were subsequently assessed, and the gills of a subset of fish were sampled for histological analyses. Nitrate-exposed fish were significantly more susceptible to acute hypoxia at both acclimation temperatures. Similarly, in 18 \textdegree C- acclimated fish, exposure to 200 mg NO3- L- 1 caused a 1 \textdegree C decrease in heat tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax). However, the opposite effect was observed in 22 \textdegree C-acclimated fish, where nitrate exposure increased heat tolerance by \textasciitilde 1 \textdegree C. Further, nitrate exposure induced some histopathological changes to the gills, which limit oxygen uptake. Our findings show that nitrate pollution can heighten the susceptibility of fish to additional threats in their habitat, but interactions are temperature dependent.},

Here, Pcrit is defined as the PO2~at which physiological oxygen supply ({$\alpha$}0) reaches its maximum capacity ({$\alpha$}; \textmu mol O2 g-1~h-1~kPa-1). {$\alpha$} is a species- and temperature-specific constant describing the oxygen dependency of the maximum metabolic rate (MMR=PO2\texttimes{$\alpha$}) or, equivalently, the MR dependence of Pcrit (Pcrit=MR/{$\alpha$}). We describe the {$\alpha$}-method, in which the MR is monitored as oxygen declines and, for each measurement period, is divided by the corresponding PO2~to provide the concurrent oxygen supply ({$\alpha$}0=MR/PO2). The highest {$\alpha$}0 value (or, more conservatively, the mean of the three highest values) is designated as {$\alpha$}. The same value of {$\alpha$} is reached at Pcrit for any MR regardless of previous or subsequent metabolic activity. The MR need not be constant (regulated), standardized or exhibit a clear breakpoint at Pcrit for accurate determination of {$\alpha$}. The {$\alpha$}-method has several advantages over Pcrit determination and non-linear analyses, including: (1) less ambiguity and greater accuracy, (2) fewer constraints in respirometry methodology and analysis, and (3) greater predictive power and ecological and physiological insight. Across the species evaluated here, {$\alpha$} values are correlated with MR, but not Pcrit. Rather than an index of hypoxia tolerance, Pcrit is a reflection of {$\alpha$}, which evolves to support maximum energy demands and aerobic scope at the prevailing temperature and oxygen level.},

We believe that Pcrit remains a useful comparator of hypoxia tolerance provided it is determined using the proper methods and hypoxia tolerance is clearly defined. Here, we review the available methods for each of the three steps of Pcrit determination: (1) measuring the most appropriate benchmark \.M O2 state for Pcrit determination (\.M O2,std, the \.M O2 required to support standard metabolic rate); (2) reducing water PO2; and (3) calculating Pcrit from the \.M O2 versus PO2 curve. We make suggestions on best practices for each step and for how to report Pcrit results to maximize their comparative value. We also discuss the concept of hypoxia tolerance and how Pcrit relates to a fish's overall hypoxia tolerance. When appropriate methods are used, Pcrit provides useful comparative physiological and ecological information about the aerobic contributions to a fish's hypoxic survival. When paired with other hypoxia-related physiological measurements (e.g. lactate accumulation, calorimetry-based measurements of metabolic depression, loss-of-equilibrium experiments), Pcrit contributes to a comprehensive understanding of how a fish combines aerobic metabolism, anaerobic metabolism and metabolic depression in an overall strategy for hypoxia tolerance.},

  abstract = {Five empirical regression models for analysis of data on rate of oxygen uptake against oxygen level are compared. The quadratic polynomial model is the best in terms of providing a good statistical fit, in ease of computation and in providing model parameters of value when comparing and grouping species. Since the intercept parameter (B0) characterizes only the position of the curve and since there was a strong negative correlation between the linear (B1) and quadratic (B2) parameters, the quadratic coefficient (B2) alone is an informative index of the shape of the curve. B2 not significantly different from zero implies oxyconformity, while B2 significantly less than zero implies an appreciable degree of regulation.},

  abstract = {Pcrit \textendash{} generally defined as the PO2 below which the animal can no longer maintain a stable rate of O2 consumption (\.M O2), such that \.M O2 becomes dependent upon PO2 \textendash{} provides a single number into which a vast amount of experimental effort has been invested. Here, with specific reference to water-breathers, I argue that this focus on the Pcrit is not useful for six reasons: (1) calculation of Pcrit usually involves selective data editing; (2) the value of Pcrit depends greatly on the way it is determined; (3) there is no good theoretical justification for the concept; (4) Pcrit is not the transition point from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, and it disguises what is really going on; (5) Pcrit is not a reliable index of hypoxia tolerance; and (6) Pcrit carries minimal information content. Preferable alternatives are loss of equilibrium (LOE) tests for hypoxia tolerance, and experimental description of full \.M O2 versus PO2 profiles accompanied by measurements of ventilation, lactate appearance and metabolic rate by calorimetry. If the goal is to assess the ability of the animal to regulate \.M O2 from this profile in a mathematical fashion, promising, more informative alternatives to Pcrit are the regulation index and Michaelis\textendash Menten or sigmoidal allosteric analyses.},
