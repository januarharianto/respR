In the two years since publication, `respR` has picked up [24 citations](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?cites=15799904892345725732&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en).

We are very happy to see the package being used to conduct quality, reproducible science, and keen to see what experiments and data users will put it towards in the future. It's been especially good to see it used for calculating oxygen production rates of algae and corals, as well as the respiration rates of a wide range of species.

If you use the package, we would appreciate a citation to the publication in [Methods in Ecology and Evolution](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13162). Iff you use it for any purpose at all (e.g. teaching, industry use. environmental reports and monitoring, etc.) please [**let us know**](mailto:nicholascarey@gmail.com).

## Studies using respR

The following publications (most recent first) have used and cited `respR`. If we have missed yours, please [**let us know**](mailto:nicholascarey@gmail.com) and we will include it in the list.

#### @killenGuidelinesReportingMethods2021

Excellent summary and guide to best practices in intermittent-flow respirometry. Still in preprint, so lots of opportunity to provide feedback. Essential reading!

#### @prinzingAnalyticalMethodsMatter2021

An excellent summary and guide to the best practices and tools available to estimate maximum metabolic rates. Goes into a lot of detail about rolling regressions, and the importance of the sampling window used, something that was instrumental to the design of `respR`. Very much required reading if you are interested in MMR, or just respirometry analyses in general.

#### @ros2021

This study looked at how physiological plasticity in invasive species can potentially predict invasion success. `respR` was used to calculate the Pcrit of native and invasive shrimp. Really nice results showing the invader having a lower Pcrit at higher temperatures than the native, potentially allowing it to tolerate hypoxic events better.

#### @rodgers2021

This study examines the effects of nitrate pollution on thermal and hypoxia sensitivity in European grayling. `respR` was used to calculate the Pcrit. They show (quite definitively, using three different PCrit methods) that Pcrit significantly increases under nitrate exposure, indicating a lower hypoxia tolerance. Nice work!

#### @pilletPhysiologicalPerformanceCommon2021

This study looked at the performance of the common carp when exposed to heavy metals, and found metabolic rates increased after 3 days of exposure. `respR` was used to process the respirometry data and calculate both SMR and MMR. Marion Pillet was a researcher who took advantage of our open offer to help get users started with `respR` by sending us a data file, so we are happy to see the work published!

#### @petreikyteEfficiencyNileTilapia2021

This MSc project examined the effects of salinity on Nile tilapia growth and physiology in aquaculture recirculation tanks, and used `respR` to calculate the metabolic rates. It's mostly in Lithuanian, so we haven't been able to figure out the details, but congrats on the MSc!

#### @legrand2021

Another study we were happy to see examining both oxygen production rates as well as consumption rates. It used `respR` to determine gross primary production by determining both oxygen production and respiration rate in coralline algae. Take home message: lots of salmon poop is bad for algae.

#### @ladakis2021

This review on methods in stress assessment studies mentions `respR` as one of the analytical options for examining respiration rates.

#### @harianto2021

Here, the package was used to calculate mass-specific metabolic rates of sea urchins from intermittent-flow respirometry data, to examine the carryover effects of acclimation to different temperatures and ocean acidification conditions. Can't say too much about this one, except it's good to see a package author still using his own tools. ðŸ˜‰

#### @evensen2021b

This study is a great example of how respirometry is not all about respiration, and exactly what we were thinking of when we designed `respR` to handle oxygen production rates as well as consumption. Here, it was used to calculate oxygen flux (net photosynthesis and respiration) of Red Sea corals under simulated heatwaves in large mesocosms.

#### @durtsche2021c

This study used `respR` to calculate the aerobic scope of juvenile brown trout to investigate the effects of egg incubation temperature. We were very happy to see the `auto_rate()` function being used to extract both most linear and maximum metabolic rates to calculate the aerobic scope, one of the primary use cases we designed it to handle.

#### @bouyoucos2021c

This study looked at thermal tolerance and oxygen supply capacity in newborn sharks. This shows a great use for `respR` outside of the lab, in that it was used to determine oxygen decline from field recordings of oxygen off the coast of Moorea. We were especially pleased to see the `auto_rate()` function get a mention in the manuscript for calculating maximum metabolic rates.

#### @zhang2020

This study compared the results of different methods of determining maximum metabolic rates. The authors point out minimum sampling window is a very important factor in determining MMR. We always thought this was pretty obvious, which is why `respR` has always allowed rolling regressions of different window sizes to be performed, with visualisations to see the results of how this affects rate calculations. ðŸ¤”

#### @zÃ¡vorka2020

This is a really cool study looking at how warming may affect brain size and cognition in minnows, as well as metabolic rate. Warm fish had bigger brains, but weren't as good at finding their way through a maze! Awesome stuff. It used `respR` to determine SMR, MMR and aerobic scope.

#### @spindel2020

We have a special fondness for studies doing respirometry on sea urchins (we feel your pain, especially the spines under the fingernails). This study compared the physiology of urchins from kelp barrens and kelp forests, and found those in barrens have dramatically reduced resting metabolic rates, by up to 40%. Cool stuff!

#### @rodriguez2020

This is another study that used `respR` to determine the Pcrit, this time of an invasive bivalve, and the authors used it to show that the lack of metabolic regulation may limit the spread of this invader.

#### @muller2020

This study looked at the effects of ocean acidification on a larval fish. The authors used `respR` to calculate SMR and MMR rates, then filtered the rates according to various criteria (above 80% oxygen, r2 above 0.85, etc.). This is a great idea, and exactly why we introduce the function `subset_rate()` in v2.0, which allows for exactly this kind of application of easily reported rate selection criteria.

#### @kurchaba2020

Amazingly, this is the only study on zebrafish to cite `respR` so far, which is surprising given how many groups are working and doing respirometry on them. This study looked at the effects of microplastics on oxygen consumption and gene expression in larval zebrafish. They did not find any effects on metabolic rate, but did on the fish microbiome, which could lead to higher susceptibility to disease.

#### @internicolaMicroplasticsDelawareBay2020

Anna M. Internicola used `respR` in this MSc project, looking at the effects of microplastics on zooplankton in Delaware Bay. She found, amongst other effects, chronic exposure increased metabolic rates. Nice work, and congrats on the Masters! ðŸ¥³

#### @gomezisazaAnthropogenicDisturbancesFreshwater2020

#### @gomezisaza2020

Daniel F. Gomez Isaza used the `calc_rate()` function to calculate mass-specific metabolic rates of juvenile silver perch to examine the effects of nitrates on thermal sensitivity in Chapter 5 of his PhD thesis and accompanying JEB paper. Thanks for the citations, and congrats on the PhD! ðŸ¥³

#### @gilbert2020

Matthew Gilbert cited `respR` in his PhD thesis as an example of how analytical tools in physiology are improving and evolving. Thanks for the citation, and congrats on the PhD! ðŸ¥³

#### @negrete2019

Another study that used `respR` to determine the Pcrit, this time of an estuarine fish. This was an examination of methods of determining Pcrit, both the analytical method of processing the metabolic rate data, and the respirometry method used (closed vs. intermittent-flow). There has been concern that closed respirometry mis-estimates Pcrit, because of the build-up of toxic metabolic end products, and intermittent-flow methods are preferable. The authors showed here this is not the case, and results were the same with either method. Really interesting stuff, and essential reading if you are wanting to determine Pcrit via respirometry.

#### @harvey2019

This study examined how diatoms dominate food webs under ocean acidification conditions. Another study that uses `respR` to examine both oxygen production as well as consumption rates. The authors used the package to determine net oxygen production by determining both production and respiration.

#### @burford2019c

This paper looked for the first time at the effects of grouping on metabolic rate in a social squid. The package was used here to calculate metabolic rates of both individual and groups of squid in a swim tunnel, and also their Pcrit. The very first paper to cite `respR` - a co-author may have had some influence on that... ðŸ¤”
