  abstract = {Temperature and oxygen limit the distribution of marine ectotherms. Haematological traits underlying bloodoxygen carrying capacity are thought to be correlated with thermal tolerance in certain fishes, and this relationship is hypothesised to be explained by oxygen supply capacity. We tested this hypothesis using reef shark neonates as experimental models because they live near their upper thermal limits and are physiologically sensitive to low oxygen conditions. We first described in situ associations between temperature and oxygen at the study site (Moorea, French Polynesia) and found that the habitats for reef shark neonates (Carcharhinus melanopterus and Negaprion acutidens) were hyperoxic at the maximum recorded temperatures. Next, we tested for in situ associations between thermal habitat characteristics and haematological traits of neonates. Contrary to predictions, we only demonstrated a negative association between haemoglobin concentration and maximum habitat temperatures in C. melanopterus. Next, we tested for ex situ associations between critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and haematological traits, but only demonstrated a negative association between haematocrit and CTMax in C. melanopterus. Finally, we measured critical oxygen tension (pcrit) ex situ and estimated its temperature sensitivity to predict oxygen-dependent values of CTMax. Estimated temperature sensitivity of pcrit was similar to reported values for sharks and skates, and predicted values for CTMax equalled maximum habitat temperatures.},

On average, the presence of conspecifics reduced routine metabolic rate by 21\% but did not influence the critical oxygen partial pressure below which a stable rate of oxygen uptake is not maintained. In addition, displays of chromatic behaviors associated with relaxation were observed more frequently in groups, whereas behaviors associated with stress or vigilance were observed more frequently in solitary individuals. We hypothesize that through a potential reduction in energy consumption, grouping may be relevant in allowing social squids to exploit habitats with marginal oxygen availability that may impose a physiological constraint.},

In the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), deep waters with low DO ({$<$}1 mg L-1) may reach coral reefs, because upwelling will likely intensify due to climate change. To understand oxygen variability and its effects on corals, we characterize the Spatio-temporal changes of DO in coral reefs of Gorgona Island and calculate the critical oxygen tension (Pcrit) to identify the DO concentration that could represent a hypoxic condition for Pocillopora capitata, one of the main reef-building species in the ETP. The mean ({$\pm$}SD) DO concentration in the coral reefs of Gorgona Island was 4.6 {$\pm$} 0.89 mg L-1. Low DO conditions were due to upwelling, but hypoxia ({$<$}3.71 mg L-1, defined as a DO value 1 SD lower than the Mean) down to 3.0 mg O2 L-1 sporadically occurred at 10 m depth. The Pcrit of P. capitata was 3.7 mg L-1 and lies close to the hypoxic condition recorded on coral reefs during the upwelling season at 10 m depth. At Gorgona Island oxygen conditions lower than 2.3 mg L-1 occur at {$>$}20 m depth and coincide with the deepest bathymetric distribution of scattered colonies of Pocillopora. Because DO concentrations in coral reefs of Gorgona Island were comparably low to other coral reefs in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, and the hypoxic threshold of P. capitata was close to the minimum DO record on reefs, hypoxic events could represent a threat if conditions that promote eutrophication (and consequently hypoxia) increase.},

  abstract = {The projected climate change and increase in thermal conditions in northern latitudes over the next 60 yr has the potential to alter the metabolic scope and potential fitness of aquatic ectotherms. Here, we experimentally tested if elevated egg incubation temperature affected metabolic scope in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) as a phenotypically plastic response. Cohorts of brown trout from anadromous and resident crosses were raised through embryogenesis in either natural river temperatures (cold) or elevated (+3\textdegree C, warm) temperatures until they could feed exogenously. The standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), and aerobic scope (AS = MMR - SMR) of juveniles from four anadromous-resident crosses and from both incubation temperatures were tested at 13\textdegree C. We found that metabolic measures (SMR, MMR, AS) were lower in warm than cold-incubated fish. There was no difference in the metabolic rates of fish from different anadromous-resident crosses. The results of this experiment are consistent with the countergradient variation hypothesis (CGV) in which phenotypic variation, in this case variation in metabolic rates, is inversely related to thermal conditions, originally proposed in relation to altitudinal or latitudinal gradients. While previous studies have related CGV to genetic differences between populations, our study shows that thermal differences encountered at the embryonic stage can produce a phenotypic pattern consistent with CGV. It is difficult to predict the consequences of these metabolic changes in a future warmer climate, as lower metabolic rates indicate that brown trout will probably expend less energy, but a reduced aerobic scope may counteract this affect, limiting their ability as a top predator and in escaping predators. Our results suggest that there are mechanisms used to adjust to elevated water temperature that can be initiated during embryogenesis. Given that there were no differences among crosses, it is likely that temperature-induced differences are the result of plastic responses.},

Here, we compare the response of a ubiquitous scleractinian coral, Stylophora pistillata, from the northern Red Sea to acute (7 h) and chronic (7\textendash 11 d) thermal stress events that include temperature treatments of 27 C (i.e., the local maximum monthly mean), 29.5 C, 32 C, and 34.5 C, and assess recovery of the corals following exposure. Overall, S. pistillata exhibited remarkably similar responses to acute and chronic thermal stress, responding primarily to the temperature treatment rather than duration or heating rate. Additionally, corals displayed an exceptionally high thermal tolerance, maintaining their physiological performance and suffering little to no loss of algal symbionts or chlorophyll a up to 32 C, before the host suffered from rapid tissue necrosis and mortality at 34.5 C. While there was some variability in physiological response metrics, photosynthetic efficiency measurements (i.e., maximum quantum yield Fv/Fm) accurately reflected the overall physiological response patterns, with these measurements used to produce the Fv/Fm effective dose (ED50) metric as a proxy for the thermal tolerance of corals. This approach produced similar ED50 values for the acute and chronic experiments (34.47 C vs. 33.81 C), highlighting the potential for acute thermal assays with measurements of Fv/Fm as a systematic and standardized approach to quantitively compare the upper thermal limits of reef-building corals using a portable experimental system.},

However, the presence of additional stressors, such as elevated nitrate concentrations, may affect the efficacy of compensatory responses. Here, juvenile silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) were exposed to current-day summer temperatures (28oC) or a future climate-warming scenario (32oC) and simultaneously exposed to one of three ecologically relevant nitrate concentrations (0, 50 or 100 mg L-1). We measured indicators of fish performance (growth, swimming), aerobic scope (AS) and upper thermal tolerance (CTMAX) to test the hypothesis that nitrate exposure would increase susceptibility to elevated temperatures and limit thermal compensatory responses. After 8 weeks of acclimation, the thermal sensitivity and plasticity of AS and swimming performance were tested at three test temperatures (28, 32, 36oC). The AS of 28oC-acclimated fish declined with increasing temperature, and the effect was more pronounced in nitrate exposed individuals. In these fish, declines in AS corresponded with poorer swimming performance and a 0.8oC decrease in CTMAX compared to unexposed fish. In contrast, acclimation to 32oC masked the effects of nitrate; fish acclimated to 32oC displayed a thermally insensitive phenotype whereby locomotor performance remained unchanged, AS was maintained and CTMAX was increased by \textasciitilde 1oC irrespective of nitrate treatment compared to fish acclimated to 28oC. Growth was however markedly reduced in 32oC-acclimated compared to 28oC-acclimated fish.

  abstract = {Copepods dominate zooplankton biomass of the upper ocean, especially in the highly seasonal boreal and polar regions, for which specific life-cycle traits such as the accumulation of lipid reserves, migration into deep water and diapause are key adaptations. Understanding such traits is central to determining the energetic consequences of high latitude range shifts related to climate change and ultimately, biogeochemical models of carbon flow. Using the calanoid copepod Calanus finmarchicus, we explore a new indicator of diapause, swimming activity, and assess its relationship with respiration. Stage CV copepods were sampled in late summer from shallow (epipelagic) and deep (mesopelagic) water at both slope and basin locations within the Fram Strait at a time when the animals had entered diapause. Using high-throughput quantitative behaviour screening on ex-situ swimming activity, we found that irrespective of sampling station copepods from the mesopelagic show highly reduced activity (88.5 {$\pm$} 3.4\% reduction) when compared to those from the epipelagic with a clearly defined threshold between epi- and mesopelagic animals (\textasciitilde 5 beam breaks 30 min-1). Mesopelagic individuals were also larger (12.4 {$\pm$} 8.8\%) and had more lipid reserves (19.3 {$\pm$} 2.2\%) than epipelagic individuals. On average, copepods from the basin station exhibited respiration rates similar to overwintering rates observed elsewhere (1.23 {$\pm$} 0.76 \textmu g C d-1), while respiration rates of copepods from the shelf station were more consistent with active metabolism (2.46 {$\pm$} 1.02 \textmu g C d-1). Nevertheless, active and diapausing rates were observed in individuals from both stations at both epi- and mesopelagic depths. We suggest that rapid screening of activity may provide an early indicator of diapause before it becomes fully apparent and consistent in other physiological indicators. Ultimately, swimming activity may provide a useful tool to assess the putative endogenous and exogenous factors involved in diapause onset, provide a handle on the energetics of diapause, and input to biogeochemical carbon models on C. finmarchicus.},

We used pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) and their endoparasites as a model system to explore the effects of infection load on host aerobic metabolism and escape performance. Metabolic traits (standard and maximum metabolic rates, aerobic scope) and faststart escape responses following a simulated aerial attack by a predator (responsiveness, response latency and escape distance) were measured in fish from across a gradient of visible (i.e. trematodes causing black spot disease counted on fish surfaces) and non-visible (i.e. cestodes in fish abdominal cavity counted post-mortem) endoparasite infection. We found that a higher infection load of non-visible endoparasites was related to lower standard and maximum metabolic rates, but not aerobic scope in fish. Nonvisible endoparasite infection load was also related to decreased responsiveness of the host to a simulated aerial attack. Visible endoparasites were not related to changes in metabolic traits or fast-start escape responses. Our results suggest that infection with parasites that are inconspicuous to researchers can result in intraspecific variation in physiological and behavioural performance in wild populations, highlighting the need to more explicitly acknowledge and account for the role played by natural infections in studies of wild animal performance.},

We investigated the effects of long-term exposure to OW and OA on the physiology of adults of the sea urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma, a species resident in the southeast Australia warming hotspot. The urchins were slowly introduced to stressor conditions in the laboratory over a 7-week adjustment period to three temperature (ambient, +2{$\smwhtcircle$}C, +3{$\smwhtcircle$}C) and two pH (ambient: pHT 8.0; -0.4 units: pHT 7.6) treatments. They were then maintained in a natural pattern of seasonal temperature and photoperiod change, and fixed pH, for 22 weeks. Survival was monitored through week 22 and metabolic rate was measured at 4 and 12 weeks of acclimation, feeding rate and ammonia excretion rate at 12 weeks and assimilation efficiency at 13 weeks. Acclimation to +3{$\smwhtcircle$}C was deleterious regardless of pH. Mortality from week 6 indicated that recent marine heatwaves are likely to have been deleterious to this species. Acclimation to +2{$\smwhtcircle$}C did not affect survival. Increased temperature decreased feeding and increased excretion rates, with no effect of acidification. While metabolic rate increased additively with temperature and low pH at week 4, there was no difference between treatments at week 12, indicating physiological acclimation in surviving urchins to stressful conditions. Regardless of treatment, H. erythrogramma had a net positive energy budget indicating that the responses were not due to energy limitation. To test for the effect of parental acclimation on offspring responses, the offspring of acclimated urchins were reared to the juvenile stage in OW and OA conditions. Parental acclimation to warming, but not acidification altered juvenile physiology with an increase in metabolic rate. Our results show that incorporation of gradual seasonal environmental change in longterm acclimation can influence outcomes, an important consideration in predicting the consequences of changing climate for marine species.},

  abstract = {Diatoms are so important in ocean food-webs that any human induced changes in their abundance could have major effects on the ecology of our seas. The large chain-forming diatom Biddulphia biddulphiana greatly increases in abundance as pCO2 increases along natural seawater CO2 gradients in the north Pacific Ocean. In areas with reference levels of pCO2, it was hard to find, but as seawater carbon dioxide levels rose, it replaced seaweeds and became the main habitat-forming species on the seabed. This diatom algal turf supported a marine invertebrate community that was much less diverse and completely differed from the benthic communities found at present-day levels of pCO2. Seawater CO2 enrichment stimulated the growth and photosynthetic efficiency of benthic diatoms, but reduced the abundance of calcified grazers such as gastropods and sea urchins. These observations suggest that ocean acidification will shift photic zone community composition so that coastal food-web structure and ecosystem function are homogenised, simplified, and more strongly affected by seasonal algal blooms.},

As processes such as respiration depend on gas exchange between  organisms and their environment, they are potentially affected by water temperature and velocity.  In this study, we compare the effects of multiple environmental stressors (temperature and flow  velocity) on the respiration rate in two mytilids, the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus  galloprovincialis and the temperate bay mussel M. trossulus. Thermal performance curves (5, 11,  17, 23, and 29 \textdegree C) for respiration rate were quantified at five different flow velocities (2, 4, 6, 10,  20 cm s-1) in a fully crossed design. Well-defined thermal performance curves were present at  moderate to high water velocities, whereas, at the lowest velocity (2 cm s-1) respiration rates  remained low across all temperatures. Although Mediterranean mussels displayed higher thermal  optima than Bay mussels under moderate flow speeds (4-6 cm s-1), those differences were absent  at higher flow velocities ({$>$}10 cm s-1). These results highlight the importance of considering  hydrodynamic conditions when estimating thermal tolerance in marine mussels.},

For short-lived species like most copepods, these extreme events can occur over both within- and between-generational time scales. Yet, it is unclear whether exposure to acute warming during early life stages of copepods can cause lingering effects on metabolism through development, even after the event has ended. These lingering effects would reduce the amount of energy devoted to growth and affect copepod population dynamics. We exposed nauplii of an ecologically important coastal species, Acartia tonsa, to a 24-hour warming event (control: 18\textdegree C; treatment: 28\textdegree C), and then tracked individual respiration rate, body length, and stage duration through development. As expected, we observed a decrease in mass-specific respiration rates as individuals developed. However, exposure to acute warming had no effect on the ontogenetic patterns in per-capita or mass-specific respiration rates, body length, or development time. The lack of these carryover effects through ontogeny suggests within-generational resilience to acute warming in this copepod species.},

  abstract = {Aim Although zebrafish are gaining popularity as biomedical models of cardiovascular disease, our understanding of their cardiac control mechanisms is fragmentary. Our goal was to clarify the controversial role of the \ss 1-adrenergic receptor (AR) in the regulation of heart rate in zebrafish. Methods CRISPR-Cas9 was used to delete the adrb1 gene in zebrafish allowing us to generate a stable adrb1-/- line. Larval heart rates were measured during pharmacological protocols and with exposure to hypercapnia. Expression of the five zebrafish adrb genes were measured in larval zebrafish hearts using qPCR. Results Compared to genetically matched wild-types (adrb1+/+), adrb1-/- larvae exhibited 20 beats min-1 lower heart rate, measured from 2 to 21 days post-fertilisation (dpf). Nevertheless, adrb1-/- larvae exhibited preserved positive chronotropic responses to pharmacological treatment with AR agonists (adrenaline, noradrenaline, isoproterenol), which were blocked by propranolol (general \ss -AR antagonist). Regardless of genotype, larvae exhibited similar increases in heart rate in response to hypercapnia (1\% CO2) at 5 dpf but the tachycardia was blunted in adrb1-/- larvae at 6 dpf. adrb1 gene expression was abolished in the hearts of adrb1-/- larvae, confirming successful knockout. While gene expression of adrb2a and adrb3a were unchanged, adrb2b and adrb3b mRNA levels increased in adrb1-/- larval hearts. Conclusion Despite adrb1 contributing to the setting of resting heart rate in larvae, it is not strictly essential for zebrafish, as we generated a viable and breeding adrb1-/- line. The chronotropic effects of adrenergic stimulation persist in adrb1-/- zebrafish, likely due to the upregulation of other \ss -AR subtypes.},

The study of metabolism in aquatic animals is undergoing an especially pronounced expansion, with more researchers utilising intermittent-flow respirometry as a research tool than ever before. Aquatic respirometry measures the rate of oxygen uptake as a proxy for metabolic rate, and the intermittent-flow technique has numerous strengths for use with aquatic animals, allowing metabolic rate to be repeatedly estimated on individual animals over several hours or days and during exposure to various conditions or stimuli. There are, however, no published guidelines for the reporting of methodological details when using this method. Here, we provide the first guidelines for reporting intermittent-flow respirometry methods, in the form of a checklist of criteria that we consider to be the minimum required for the interpretation, evaluation and replication of experiments using intermittent-flow respirometry. Furthermore, using a survey of the existing literature, we show that there has been incomplete and inconsistent reporting of methods for intermittent-flow respirometry over the past few decades. Use of the provided checklist of required criteria by researchers when publishing their work should increase consistency of the reporting of methods for studies that use intermittent-flow respirometry. With the steep increase in studies using intermittent-flow respirometry, now is the ideal time to standardise reporting of methods, so that \textendash{} in the future \textendash{} data can be properly assessed by other scientists and conservationists.},

  abstract = {Plastic polymers have quickly become one of the most abundant materials on Earth due to their low production cost and high versatility. Unfortunately, some of the discarded plastic can make its way into the environment and become fragmented into smaller microscopic particles, termed secondary microplastics (MP). In addition, primary MP, purposely manufactured microscopic plastic particles, can also make their way into our environment via various routes. Owing to their size and resilience, these MP can then be easily ingested by living organisms. The effect of MP particles on living organisms is suspected to have negative implications, especially during early development. In this study, we examined the effects of polyethylene MP ingestion for four and ten days of exposure starting at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). In particular, we examined the effects of polyethylene MP exposure on resting metabolic rate, on gene expression of several inflammatory and oxidative stress linked genes, and on microbiome composition between treatments. Overall, we found no evidence of broad metabolic disturbances or inflammatory markers in MP-exposed fish for either period of time. However, there was a significant increase in the oxidative stress mediator L-FABP that occurred at 15 dpf. Furthermore, the microbiome was disrupted by MP exposure, with evidence of an increased abundance of Bacteroidetes in MP fish, a combination frequently found in intestinal pathologies. Thus, it appears that acute polyethylene MP exposure can increase oxidative stress and dysbiosis, which may render the animal more susceptible to diseases.},

Of particular concern in Norway is the potential impact of open net pen aquaculture on CWC reefs formed by Lophelia pertusa, a threatened and declining habitat. We conducted a 1 yr in situ transplantation experiment and corresponding field measurements of 2 reefs located close to fish farms to elucidate the impacts of particulate organic waste released from the farms on coral colonies. Our study provided new evidence of negative impacts of organic effluents on L. pertusa ecophysiology. After 1 yr, both naturally occurring and transplanted corals, at distances ranging from 250 m to 1 km downstream of what would be regarded as an averagesized Norwegian fish farm, exhibited depressed metabolic rates compared to corals outside the main depositional footprint of the farms. The metabolic depression impeded energy acquisition, reducing growth and energy reserves by up to 70 and 50\%, respectively. No clear threshold for significant biological impact could be detected along a distance gradient. Instead, a gradual decrease in metabolic rates, growth and lipid reserves occurred with increasing modelled sedimentation rate of organic waste from the farm. The strong statistical correlation between oxygen consumption, growth, energy stores and sedimentation rates implies that predictions of the shortterm impact of aquaculture effluents on L. pertusa ecophysiology and CWC reef development may be achievable in the future. This would significantly improve the ability of management to make informed decisions on the licensing of new farms near CWC reefs.},

Moreover, a brief synopsis of biosignals that are used for the detection and categorization of stress and their analysis is presented. Methods: Several studies, articles and reviews were included after literature research. The main questions of the research were: the most important and widely used physiological signals for stress detection/ assessment, the analysis methods for their manipulation and the implementation of signal analysis for stress detection/assessment in various developed systems. Findings: The main conclusion is that current researching approaches lead to more sophisticated methods of analysis and more accurate systems of stress detection and assessment. However, the lack of a concrete framework towards stress detection and assessment remains a great challenge for the research community.},

The rapid expansion of the Atlantic salmon Salmo salar aquaculture industry in Norway may have major impacts on surrounding maerl beds through the release of effluents, including fish faeces. This study is the first to test the effects of salmon faeces and inorganic sediment deposition on the photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and pigment content of the coralline alga Lithothamnion soriferum. In a 6 wk laboratory experiment, inorganic sediment and salmon faeces deposition significantly reduced the amount of light reaching the surface of coralline algae. No impact of inorganic sediment deposition was detected on L. soriferum physiology, while salmon faeces deposition increased respiration rate and reduced net primary production and calcification. The accumulation of salmon faeces stimulates proliferation of bacteria, with adverse consequences on L. soriferum physiology due to the potential release of toxic compounds. Burial by salmon faeces deposition also affects the physiology of coralline algae due to the flocculation of sticky faeces particles, which may limit nutrient and gas exchanges in the vicinity of thalli. Carbon dioxide accumulation in the vicinity of L. soriferum may lead to a decline in pH and alter the calcification process in cell walls. In natural maerl beds, the negative effect of faeces deposition may be exacerbated by longer-term exposure and the presence of other chemicals released by fish farms.},

Both emersion and Cu toxicity can cause damage to physiological processes like aerobic metabolism, ammonia excretion, and osmoregulation, but the interactions of the combination of these two stressors on marine invertebrates are understudied. Mixed effects of 96\,h of low and high Cu exposure (20 and 200\,{$\mu$}g/L) followed by 6\,h of tidal emersion were evaluated on the intertidal sea cucumber Cucumaria miniata. The respiratory tree accumulated the highest concentrations of Cu, followed by the introvert retractor muscle, body wall, and coelomic fluid. Emersion affected accumulation of Cu, perhaps by inhibiting excretion. 200\,{$\mu$}g/L of Cu increased lactate production in the respiratory tree, indicative of damaged aerobic metabolism. Cu diminished ammonia excretion, but emersion increased oxygen uptake and ammonia excretion upon re-immersion. The combination of the two stressors did not have any interactive effects on metabolism or ammonia excretion. Neither Cu exposure nor emersion altered ion (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium) content of the coelomic fluid. Overall, results of this study suggest that Cu exposure does not alter C. miniata's high tolerance to emersion, and some potential strategies that this species uses to overcome environmental stress are illuminated.},

The absence of one species from the warmest reefs results from vital activity restrictions during episodic low oxygen extremes, even though average conditions are well within physiological tolerance limits. Over the past decade, warmer temperatures have been significantly correlated with a greater frequency and intensity of hypoxic events. Continued warming will progressively exclude hypoxia-tolerant species, even if average oxygen remains constant.

Recent research suggests that their co-occurrence is more common than previously thought and that their combination can have rapid, dire biological impacts. We used the sea urchin Echinometra lucunter to determine whether mortality occurs faster when deoxygenation events are combined with extreme heating (compound events), compared to deoxygenation events alone. We also tested whether prior exposure to local heatwave conditions accentuates the impacts of compound events. Animals were first exposed for five days to either ambient temperature (28 7C) or a warmer temperature that met the minimum criteria for a local heatwave (30.5 7C). Animals were then exposed to hypoxia, defined as oxygen levels 35\% below their average critical oxygen limit, combined with ambient or extreme field temperatures (28 7C, 32 7C). Subsets of animals were removed from the hypoxic treatments every 3 hours for 24 hours to determine how long they could survive. Prior exposure to heatwave conditions did not help or hinder survival under hypoxic conditions, and animals exposed to hypoxia under ambient temperatures experienced little mortality. However, when hypoxia was coupled with extreme temperatures (32 7C), 55\% of the animals died within 24 hours. On the reefs at our Panama study site, we found that extreme hypoxic conditions only ever occurred during marine heatwave events, with four compound events occurring in 2018. These results show that short durations ({$\sim$}1 day) of compound events can be catastrophic and that increases in their duration will severely threaten sea urchin populations.},

  abstract = {Coral reef metabolism underpins ecosystem function and is defined by the processes of photosynthesis, respiration, calcification, and calcium carbonate dissolution. However, the relationships between these physiological processes at the organismal level and their interactions with light remain unclear. We examined metabolic rates across a range of photosynthesising calcifiers in the Caribbean: the scleractinian corals Acropora cervicornis, Orbicella faveolata, Porites astreoides, and Siderastrea siderea, and crustose coralline algae (CCA) under varying natural light conditions. Net photosynthesis and calcification showed a parabolic response to light across all species, with differences among massive corals, branching corals, and CCA that reflect their relative functional roles on the reef. At night, all organisms were net respiring, and most were net calcifying, although some incubations demonstrated instances of net calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolution. Peak metabolic rates at light-saturation (maximum photosynthesis and calcification) and average dark rates (respiration and dark calcification) were positively correlated across species. Interspecies relationships among photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification indicate that calcification rates are linked to energy production at the organismal level in calcifying reef organisms. The species-specific ratios of net calcification to photosynthesis varied with light over a diurnal cycle. The dynamic nature of calcification/photosynthesis ratios over a diurnal cycle questions the use of this metric as an indicator for reef function and health at the ecosystem scale unless temporal variability is accounted for, and a new metric is proposed. The complex light-driven dynamics of metabolic processes in coral reef organisms indicate that a more comprehensive understanding of reef metabolism is needed for predicting the future impacts of global change.},

  abstract = {Significance             Plastic individuals can buffer environmental changes, maintaining a stable performance across gradients. Plasticity is therefore thought to be particularly beneficial for the survival of wild populations that experience large environmental fluctuations, such as diel and seasonal temperature changes. Maintaining plasticity is widely assumed to be costly; however, empirical evidence demonstrating this cost is scarce. Here, we predict that if plasticity is costly, it would be readily lost in a stable environment, such as a laboratory. To test this, we measured a diverse range of phenotypic traits, spanning gene expression, physiology, and behavior, in wild and laboratory zebrafish acclimated to 15 temperatures. We show that laboratory fish have lost plasticity in many traits, demonstrating that maintaining plasticity carries a cost.           ,              Plasticity can allow organisms to maintain consistent performance across a wide range of environmental conditions. However, it remains largely unknown how costly plasticity is and whether a trade-off exists between plasticity and performance under optimal conditions. Biological rates generally increase with temperature, and to counter that effect, fish use physiological plasticity to adjust their biochemical and physiological functions. Zebrafish in the wild encounter large daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations, suggesting they should display high physiological plasticity. Conversely, laboratory zebrafish have been at optimal temperatures with low thermal fluctuations for over 150 generations. We treated this domestication as an evolution experiment and asked whether this has reduced the physiological plasticity of laboratory fish compared to their wild counterparts. We measured a diverse range of phenotypic traits, from gene expression through physiology to behavior, in wild and laboratory zebrafish acclimated to 15 temperatures from 10\,\textdegree C to 38\,\textdegree C. We show that adaptation to the laboratory environment has had major effects on all levels of biology. Laboratory fish show reduced plasticity and are thus less able to counter the direct effects of temperature on key traits like metabolic rates and thermal tolerance, and this difference is detectable down to gene expression level. Rapid selection for faster growth in stable laboratory environments appears to have carried with it a trade-off against physiological plasticity in captive zebrafish compared with their wild counterparts.},

The early life stages of fishes, being particularly sensitive to environmental deviations, represent a critical bottleneck to recruitment. We investigated the effects of ocean acidification ({$\increment$}pH = -0.4) on the oxygen consumption and morphometry during the early ontogeny of a commercially important seabream, Chrysoblephus laticeps, up until flexion. Hatchlings appeared to be tolerant to hypercapnic conditions, exhibiting no difference in oxygen consumption or morphometry between treatments, although the yolk reserves were marginally reduced in the low-pH treatment. The preflexion stages appeared to undergo metabolic depression, exhibiting lower metabolic rates along with lower growth metrics in hypercapnic conditions. However, although the sample sizes were low, the flexion-stage larvae exhibited greater rates of metabolic and growth metric increases in hypercapnic conditions. This study shows that the effects of OA may be stage specific during early ontogeny and potentially related to the development of crucial organs, such as the gills. Future studies investigating the effects of climate change on fish larvae should endeavour to include multiple developmental stages in order to make more accurate predictions on recruitment dynamics for the coming decades.},

This study used a paired design on the marine teleost, red drum. Pcrit is comparable between closed (4.6{$\pm$} 0.2 kPa; mean{$\pm$}s.e.m.) and intermittent flow (4.4{$\pm$}0.2 kPa; mean{$\pm$} s.e.m.) respirometry. pCO2, ammonia and pH changes within the chamber were measured prior to the onset of Pcrit and at the end of a typical Pcrit trial and revealed changes in water chemistry in both closed and intermittent flow.

Such interactions elicit beneficial effects on clients' ecophysiology, with cascading effects on fish diversity and abundance. Ocean acidification (OA), resulting from increasing CO2 concentrations, can affect the behavior of cleaner fishes making them less motivated to inspect their clients. This is especially important as gnathiid fish ectoparasites are tolerant to ocean acidification. Here, we investigated how access to cleaning services, performed by the cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus, affect individual client's (damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis) aerobic metabolism in response to both experimental parasite infection and OA. Access to cleaning services was modulated using a long-term removal experiment where cleaner wrasses were consistently removed from patch reefs around Lizard Island (Australia) for 17~years or left undisturbed. Only damselfish with access to cleaning stations had a negative metabolic response to parasite infection (maximum metabolic rate\textemdash\.MO2Max; and both factorial and absolute aerobic scope). Moreover, after an acclimation period of 10~days to high CO2 ({$\sim$}1,000~\textmu atm CO2), the fish showed a decrease in factorial aerobic scope, being the lowest in fish without the access to cleaners. We propose that stronger positive selection for parasite tolerance might be present in reef fishes without the access to cleaners, but this might come at a cost, as readiness to deal with parasites can impact their response to other stressors, such as OA.},

  address = {{Lithuania}},
  abstract = {There are many areas in the world where scarcity of freshwater are threatening the human population. So humans have to look for solutions to replace freshwater when use of it is not necessary. This also has an effect to aquaculture \textendash{} more and more farmers are farming freshwater fish in brackish water. Many authors have demonstrated the benefits of brackish water for fish growth and other physiological functions. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is valuable fish for its tolerance to high temperatures, salinity, low amount of dissolved oxygen. They are fairly easy to farm and the quality of the meat and the taste is good. But, despite all the qualities, farmers in Lithuania do not choose to farm these fish. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of brackish water on the efficiency of Nile tilapia aquaculture technology. To achieve the goal an experiment was conducted in the Laboratory of Fishery and Aquaculture of the Marine Research Institute of Klaipeda University on August 5 December 18, 2020. During it, three separate recirculating aquaculture systems were constructed from system B. One such system consisted of three tanks. Tank volume \textendash{} 2,83 m3. Total amount of biofilter filler \textendash{} 130 L, water inflow \textendash{} 36 L min-1. All tanks were equipped with the same bio and mechanical filters, oxygen diffusers, the room is heated by heaters. In the experiment water of three different salinities were used: fresh water (0\textperthousand ), water from the Baltic Sea (6\textperthousand ) and diluted sea water (3\textperthousand ). The remaining three basins are used as reserve tanks for storing and diluting seawater. Seawater is pumped to the laboratory from the shores of the Baltic Sea, and fresh water is obtained from a well. Nile tilapia were sorted and distributed into tanks. At the beginning of the study, the average fish weight was: 0\textperthousand{} \textendash{} 84,4 {$\pm$} 19,51 g, 3\textperthousand{} \textendash{} 81,28 {$\pm$} 22,31 g, 6\textperthousand{} \textendash{} 84,08 {$\pm$} 16.47 g, stocking density - 0\textperthousand{} \textendash{} 8,08 kg m-3, 3\textperthousand{} ir 6\textperthousand{} \textendash{} po 8,22 kg m 3. Fish were acclimatized for three weeks, their health and behavior were monitored. Water quality parameters were measured daily \textendash{} temperature (\textdegree C), dissolved oxygen content (\%), pH. Tests of water saples from each system were conducted to determine the amount of ammonium (NH4), nitrite (NO2) and nitrate (NO3) in the water. Dead fish were counted. During the experiment, approximately every three weeks, 30 fishes were randomly caught and measured from tank. Caught individuals were placed in plastic buckets filled with water. If present, juveniles were collected. Eggs and larvae were photographed, the amount was counted from the photo and fry was counted by transferring from one container to another. Counted juveniles were released into individual aquariums filled with water of appropriate salinity. Adult individuals were weighed, the total length (L) and the length to the caudal fin (l) were measured. During the last two measurements, the sex of the fish was determined according to the shape and size of the papilla and the urogenital organs. A toluidine blue solution diluted with distilled water was used for determination of gender. At the end of the experiment, the following were calculated: mean fish weight, specific growth rate (SGR), weight gain ({$\Delta$}w), feed conversion ratio (FCR), initial and final Fulton coefficients (Ki and Kf), final biomass, and survival. A respiration experiment was conducted using Nile tilapia juveniles to determine their metabolic rate (MO2). A PyroScience FireSting O2 optical oxygen meter was used for the respiration experiment. Experiment was conducted in two trials. First one: water of different salinity (0\textperthousand, 3\textperthousand, 6\textperthousand ) was added to each respirometry system, the water temperature was 22 \textdegree C. Juveniles from 0\textperthousand{} aquarium were placed in 0\textperthousand{} system, from 3\textperthousand{} to 3\textperthousand{} systems and from 6\textperthousand{} aquarium to 6\textperthousand{} system. Second trial: water of different salinity (0\textperthousand, 3\textperthousand, 6\textperthousand ) was added to each system, the water temperature was 23 \textdegree C., Juveniles from 0\textperthousand, 3\textperthousand{} and 6\textperthousand{} aquariums were placed in each system. Intermitted respirometry method were used: when the amount of oxygen dropped \textasciitilde{} 2 mg L-1 from the initial amount, the water was renewed \textendash{} the former water was poured out of the bottle and a new, well-oxygenated water was added. Fry in the bottles were not changed. After the experiment, the fry was weighed (g). A study of physico-chemical properties of fish meat was conducted. After the growth experiment, three females and three males were randomly transferred from each pool to the reservoirs of the system with water of appropriate salinity. A total of 54 tilapias were used in the study. Skinless fish fillets were used for the study, each piece was weighed. A total of 18 samples were taken, 6 from each system (3 females and 3 males). Due to the low weight of the female fillets, the samples were pooled \textendash{} one sample consisted of three fish using one half of their fillets. Samples were kept on ice until they reached the laboratory. The study of physico-chemical properties of meat was performed at the Veterinary Academy of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences. The percentage of protein, fat, ash, dry matter, water binding and water content of the sample was determined and the pH was determined. In this study were found that water salinity had a statistically significant effect on dissolved oxygen content, pH, and nitrite content in water. Also, due failed adaptation of freshwater recirculating aquaculture system to the brackish water, the water quality deteriorated during the study, especially in the 6 \textperthousand{} system, which affected other results. Growth and feed conversion ratios did not differ statistically significantly under different salinity conditions. The worst survival was in the 6 \textperthousand{} system due to deteriorating water quality during the study, and the best in the 0 \textperthousand{} system. Gender had a statistically significant effect on fish weight, with the final weight of males being 54\% higher than females. Brackish water conditions did not significantly affect the spawning of Nile tilapia females, larval and fry amount. There were also no statistically significant differences in the measurement of pup metabolic rate. When assessing meat quality, there was a statistically significant difference in meat pH and water content between systems. Water content in fish meat also differed statistically significantly between the sexes.},

It is important to analyze the impact of combined factors to obtain a realistic understanding of the mixed stress occurring in nature. In this study, the physiological performance of juvenile common carp (Cyprinus carpio) exposed for one week to an environmentally relevant metal mixture (4.8~{$\mu$}g/L of copper; 2.9~{$\mu$}g/L of cadmium and 206.8~{$\mu$}g/L of zinc) and to two temperatures (10~\textdegree C and 20~\textdegree C), were evaluated. After 1, 3 and 7~days, standard (SMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) were measured and aerobic scope (AS) was calculated. In addition, hematocrit, muscle lactate, histology of the gills and metal accumulation in gills were measured. While SMR, MMR and AS were elevated at the higher temperature, the metal mixture did not have a strong effect on these parameters. At 20~\textdegree C, SMR transiently increased, but no significant changes were observed for MMR and AS. During metal exposure, hematocrit levels were elevated in the 20~\textdegree C group. The bioaccumulation of Cd in the gills reflected the increased metabolic rate at the higher temperature, with more accumulation at 20~\textdegree C than at 10~\textdegree C. Anaerobic metabolism was not increased, which corresponds with the lack of significant histopathological damage in the gill tissue. These results show that common carp handled these metal exposures well, although increased temperature led to higher Cd accumulation and necessitated increased hematocrit levels to maintain aerobic performance.},

  abstract = {Advances in experimental design and equipment have simplified the collection of maximum metabolic rate (MMR) data for a more diverse array of water-\-breathing animals. However, little attention has been given to the consequences of analytical choices in the estimation of MMR. Using different analytical methods can reduce the comparability of MMR estimates across species and studies and has consequences for the burgeoning number of macroecological meta-\-analyses using metabolic rate data. Two key analytical choices that require standardization are the time interval, or regression window width, over which MMR is estimated, and the method used to locate that regression window within the raw oxygen depletion trace. Here, we consider the effect of both choices by estimating MMR for two shark and two salmonid species of different activity levels using multiple regression window widths and three analytical methods: rolling regression, sequential regression, and segmented regression. Shorter regression windows yielded higher metabolic rate estimates, with a risk that the shortest windows ({$<$}1-\-min) reflect more system noise than MMR signal. Rolling regression was the best candidate model and produced the highest MMR estimates. Sequential regression models consistently produced lower relative estimates than rolling regression models, while the segmented regression model was unable to produce consistent MMR estimates across individuals. The time-\-point of the MMR regression window along the oxygen consumption trace varied considerably across individuals but not across models. We show that choice of analytical method, in addition to more widely understood experimental choices, profoundly affect the resultant estimates of MMR. We recommend that researchers (1) employ a rolling regression model with a reliable regression window tailored to their experimental system and (2) explicitly report their analytical methods, including publishing raw data and code.},

Theories suggest energy metabolism determines life-history variation by modulating resource acquisition and allocation trade-offs, but the genetic underpinnings of the relationship and its dependence on ecological conditions have rarely been demonstrated. The strong genetic determination of age-at-maturity by two unlinked genomic regions (vgll3 and six6) makes Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) an ideal model to address these questions. Using more than 250 juveniles in common garden conditions, we quantified the covariation between metabolic phenotypes\textemdash standard and maximum metabolic rates (SMR and MMR), and aerobic scope (AS)\textemdash and the life-history genomic regions, and tested if food availability modulates the relationships. We found that the early maturation genotype in vgll3 was associated with higher MMR and consequently AS. Additionally, MMR exhibited physiological epistasis; it was decreased when late maturation genotypes co-occurred in both genomic regions. Contrary to our expectation, the life-history genotypes had no effects on SMR. Furthermore, food availability had no effect on the genetic covariation, suggesting a lack of genotype-by-environment interactions. Our results provide insights on the key organismal processes that link energy use at the juvenile stage to age-at-maturity, indicating potential mechanisms by which metabolism and life-history can coevolve.},

Measuring organismal metabolic rates is, therefore, at the center of explaining the physiological states of organisms, their ecological roles, and the impact of environmental change on species within terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. On coral reefs, measures of metabolism have been used to quantify symbiosis functioning between corals and their obligate algal symbionts (Symbiodiniaceae), as well as assess how environmental stressors, including climate change, will impact coral health. Despite this significance, there is a lack of methods, and therefore data, relating to metabolic rate measurements in coral offspring, likely due to their small size. To address this gap, this study aimed to develop a custom setup for measuring the respiration of small (millimeter size range) marine animal ecologies. This low cost and easy setup should allow for the improved measurement of metabolic rate. This will be essential for applied ecological research utilizing the sexual production of corals for reef restoration.},

We agree and expand on the importance of cross-disciplinary integration and transparency to improve consensus building and advance climate change research in experimental biology. We investigated reproducible research practices in experimental biology through a review of open data and analysis code associated with empirical studies on three debated paradigms and for unrelated studies published in leading journals in comparative physiology and behavioural ecology over the last 10\hspace{0.25em}years. Nineteen per cent of studies on the three paradigms had open data, and 3.2\% had open code. Similarly, 12.1\% of studies in the journals we examined had open data, and 3.1\% had open code. Previous research indicates that only 50\% of shared datasets are complete and re-usable, suggesting that fewer than 10\% of studies in experimental biology have usable open data. Encouragingly, our results indicate that reproducible research practices are increasing over time, with data sharing rates in some journals reaching 75\% in recent years. Rigorous empirical research in experimental biology is key to understanding the mechanisms by which climate change affects organisms, and ultimately promotes evidence-based conservation policy and practice. We argue that a greater adoption of open science practices, with a particular focus on FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable) data and code, represents a much-needed paradigm shift towards improved transparency, cross-disciplinary integration, and consensus building to maximize the contributions of experimental biologists in addressing the impacts of environmental change on living organisms.},

Stressors can interact in unanticipated ways, where exposure to one stressor may heighten or reduce resilience to another stressor. We examined how a leading threat to aquatic species, nitrate pollution, affects susceptibility to hypoxia and heat stress in a salmonid, the European grayling (Thymallus thymallus). Fish were exposed to nitrate pollution (0, 50 or 200 mg NO3- L-1) at two acclimation temperatures (18 \textdegree C or 22 \textdegree C) for eight weeks. Hypoxia- and heattolerance were subsequently assessed, and the gills of a subset of fish were sampled for histological analyses. Nitrate-exposed fish were significantly more susceptible to acute hypoxia at both acclimation temperatures. Similarly, in 18 \textdegree C- acclimated fish, exposure to 200 mg NO3- L- 1 caused a 1 \textdegree C decrease in heat tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax). However, the opposite effect was observed in 22 \textdegree C-acclimated fish, where nitrate exposure increased heat tolerance by \textasciitilde 1 \textdegree C. Further, nitrate exposure induced some histopathological changes to the gills, which limit oxygen uptake. Our findings show that nitrate pollution can heighten the susceptibility of fish to additional threats in their habitat, but interactions are temperature dependent.},

  abstract = {The invasiveness of Corbicula largillierti has been underestimated, but this bivalve is currently receiving more attention. The first study of the distribution of this species along one of the major basins of central Argentina showed that it was completely absent in the major central reservoir, but was present along its tributary and effluent rivers. Ten years later, this discontinuous distribution has not changed, despite the bivalve's high dispersion capacity. The main environmental differences between the reservoir and the rivers are that the former has finer sediment grain size, higher temperatures, and lower oxygen concentration during summer months. This study aimed to evaluate whether one of these factors could be limiting the distribution of C. largillierti. We assessed the metabolic response and burial behavior (under different grain sizes) of C. largillierti over 8 weeks at 30\textdegree C against a control condition at 20\textdegree C. We also analyzed the oxygen consumption (vO2) as a function of environmental oxygen concentration (pO2) at 25\textdegree C, estimating its metabolic regulation capacity (R). This showed the existence of an environmental oxygen concentration threshold (Pt) that could be an indicative of physiological limiting concentrations that compromise species survival and settlement. After 8 weeks at 30\textdegree C, the metabolic rate of individuals of C. largillierti increased and their burial behavior was slightly compromised but mostly for coarser sediments. Concerning environmental oxygen availability, C. largillierti is an oxyconformer with a low R (39.9\%), a clear pattern of negative regulation, and a low Pt (48.4\% air saturation). The lack of any regulation capacity of C. largillierti under environmental oxygen limitations and the extremely low pO2 at the bottom of the reservoir during summer months may explain its failure to colonize and survive there.},

  abstract = {The role of ecophysiology in mediating marine biological pollution is poorly known. Here we explore how physiological plasticity to environmental stress can explain and predict the context-dependencies of invasive species impacts. We use the case of two sympatric skeleton shrimps, the invader Caprella scaura and its congener C. equilibra, which is currently replaced by the former on the South European coast. We compare their physi\- ological responses to hyposalinity stress under suboptimal low and high temperature, while inferring on hypoxia tolerance. We use an energy-redox approach, analyzing mortality rate, the energetic balance and the consequent effects on the oxidative homeostasis. We found that decreased seawater salinity and/or oxygen levels can weaken biotic resistance, especially in females of C. equilibra, leading to periods of heightened vulnerability to invasion. Our approach provides mechanistic insights towards understanding the factors promoting invader impacts, highlighting the potential of ecophysiology for improving invasive species management.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The proliferation of sea urchins can decimate macroalgal forests in coastal ecosystems, leading to persistent barren seascapes. While kelp forests are among the most productive ecosystems on the planet, productivity in these urchin barrens is dramatically reduced. Moreover, urchins inhabiting these food-depauperate barrens face starvation and many survive in these barrens for years or decades. Urchins in barrens can persist by eating food subsidies from drift algae, pelagic salps, tubeworms, as well as encrusting and filamentous algae, microbial mats, and slow-growing species resistant to herbivory. Despite both food from endogenous production and exogenous subsidies, many urchins in barrens likely experience prolonged food deprivation. This resource limitation may create a trade-off between reproduction and survival; for example, fecundity of purple sea urchins (\emph{Strongylocentrotus purpuratus}) is 99.9\% lower in barrens. Despite food constraints, red sea urchins (\emph{Mesocentrotus franciscanus}), the dominant urchin species at our study sites, can live in excess of 100 years and barrens in Haida Gwaii, British Columbia (BC), Canada, have persisted for at least 143 years. While these phenomena are widespread and well documented, the bioenergetic adaptations that allow urchins to persist in these food-depauperate barrens remain poorly understood. To quantify habitat-specific differences in metabolic rates and energy reserves (as measured by gonadal mass), we conducted respirometry on and measured gonadal mass in \emph{M. franciscanus} at three locations in BC inside and outside of adjacent kelp forest and barrens habitat. Here we demonstrate that \emph{M. franciscanus} in barrens versus kelp forests have substantially lower energy reserves and, importantly, also exhibit dramatic reductions in size-specific resting metabolic rates (RMR), even after standardizing by metabolically active body mass. On average, gonadal mass was 44.6\% lower and RMR scaled to metabolically active body mass was 40\% lower in barrens urchins than in kelp forest urchins. Such a shift in metabolic rate may provide a mechanism that facilitates barren state stability over long time scales as \emph{M. franciscanus} can lower energetic demands while they wait for small pulses of food, scrape by on low-productivity resources, and suppress recruitment of macroalgae for months, years, or decades.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Commercial fishery harvest is a powerful evolutionary agent, but we know little about whether environmental stressors affect harvest-associated selection. We test how parasite infection relates to trapping vulnerability through selective processes underlying capture. We used fish naturally infected with parasites, including trematodes causing black spots under fish skin. We first assessed how individual parasite density related to standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and absolute aerobic scope (AAS)\textemdash then used laboratory fishing simulations to test how capture vulnerability was related to parasite density. We further explored group-trapping dynamics using experimental shoals containing varying proportions of infected fish (groups of six with either 0, 2, 4 or 6 infected individuals). At the individual level, we found a positive relationship between parasite presence and SMR, but not MMR or AAS. While we saw no relationship between individual metabolic capacity and vulnerability to trapping, we found the length of time fish spent in traps increased with increasing parasite density, a predictor of trapping-related capture probability. At the group level, the number of infected individuals in a shoal did not affect overall group trapping vulnerability. Our results suggest that parasite infection has some capacity to shift individual vulnerability patterns in fisheries, and potentially influence the evolutionary outcomes of fisheries-induced evolution.},

  abstract = {Energetic cost of growth determines how much food-derived energy is needed to produce a given amount of new biomass and thereby influences energy transduction between trophic levels. Growth and development are regulated by hormones and are therefore sensitive to changes in temperature and environmental endocrine disruption. Here, we show that the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) at an environmentally relevant concentration (10 \textmu gl-1) decreased fish (Danio rerio) size at 30\textdegree C water temperature. Under the same conditions, it significantly increased metabolic rates and the energetic cost of growth across development. By contrast, BPA decreased the cost of growth at cooler temperatures (24\textdegree C). BPA-mediated changes in cost of growth were not associated with mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratios (i.e. adenosine diphosphate (ADP) used/oxygen consumed) and respiratory control ratios) although BPA did increase mitochondrial proton leak. In females, BPA decreased age at maturity at 24\textdegree C but increased it at 30\textdegree C, and it decreased the gonadosomatic index suggesting reduced investment into reproduction. Our data reveal a potentially serious emerging problem: increasing water temperatures resulting from climate warming together with endocrine disruption from plastic pollution can impact animal growth efficiency, and hence the dynamics and resilience of animal populations and the services these provide.},

A possible, but rarely considered mechanism is that metabolic response of ectotherms to warming associate with changes in brain morphology and functioning. Here we compared aerobic metabolism, volume of brain, boldness, and accuracy of maze solving of common minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) acclimated for eight months to either their current optimal natural (14 \textdegree C) or warm (20 \textdegree C) water temperature. Metabolic rates indicated increased energy expenditure in warm acclimated fish, but also at least partial thermal compensation as warm acclimate fish maintained high aerobic scope. Warm acclimated fish had larger brain than cool acclimated fish. Volume of dorsal medulla relative to the overall brain size was larger in warm than cool acclimated fish, but proportion of other brain regions did not differ between the temperature treatments. Warm acclimated fish did not differ in boldness but did more errors than cool acclimated fish in exploring the maze across four trials. Inter-individual differences in numbers of exploration errors were repeatable across the four trials of the maze test. Our findings suggest that in warm environments, maintaining a high aerobic scope which is important for the performance of physically demanding tasks, can come at the cost of changes in brain morphology and impairment of the capacity to explore novel environments. This trade-off could have strong fitness implications for wild ectotherms.},

  abstract = {The stress response is essential for animal self-defense and survival. However, species may exhibit stress response variation depending on their specific environmental and selection pressures. Blind cavefish dwell in cave environments, which differ markedly in stressors and resource availability compared to surface aquatic environments. However, whether blind cavefish exhibit differences in stress response as an adaptation to their cave environments remains unclear. Here, we investigated differences in stress response in six closely related \emph{Triplophysa} species, including three blind cavefish (\emph{T. longibarbata}, \emph{T. jiarongensis}, and \emph{T. rosa}) and three normal-sighted river fish (\emph{T. nasobarbatula}, \emph{T. dongsaiensis}, and \emph{T. bleekeri}). Results showed that blind cavefish exhibited a range of distinct behavioral responses compared to sighted river fish, including greater levels of activity, shorter duration of freezing, absence of erratic movements or thrashing behavior, and opposite behavioral trends over time. Furthermore, the cavefish species demonstrated attenuated increases in metabolic rate in response to stressors related to novel environments. Cave-dwelling \emph{T. rosa} also exhibited lower basal hypothalamic-pituitary-inter-renal (HPI) axis-related gene expression levels and stress hormone concentrations compared to river-dwelling \emph{T. bleekeri}. These results suggest that blind cavefish may have lost their behavioral stress response, potentially mediated by a reduction in basal activity of the HPI axis, thus enabling the conservation of energy by reducing unnecessary expenditure in energy-limited caves.},

  abstract = {This study hypothesized that oxygen uptake (\.MO2) measured with a novel protocol of chasing rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss to exhaustion inside a static respirometer while simultaneously monitoring \.MO2 (\.MO2chase) would generate the same and repeatable peak value as when peak active \.MO2 (\.MO2active) is measured in a critical swimming speed protocol. To reliably determine peak \.MO2chase, and compare to the peak during recovery of \.MO2 after a conventional chase protocol outside the respirometer (\.MO2rec), this study applied an iterative algorithm and a minimum sampling window duration (i.e., 1 min based on an analysis of the variance in background and exercise \.MO2) to account for \.MO2 dynamics. In support of this hypothesis, peak \.MO2active (707 {$\pm$} 33 mg O2 h-1 kg-1) and peak \.MO2chase (663 {$\pm$} 43 mg O2 h-1 kg-1) were similar (P = 0.49) and repeatable (Pearson's and Spearman's correlation test; r {$\geq$} 0.77; P {$<$} 0.05) when measured in the same fish. Therefore, estimates of \.MO2max can be independent of whether a fish is exhaustively chased inside a respirometer or swum to fatigue in a swim tunnel, provided \.MO2 is analysed with an iterative algorithm and a minimum but reliable sampling window. The importance of using this analytical approach was illustrated by peak \.MO2chase being 23\% higher (P {$<$} 0.05) when compared with a conventional sequential interval regression analysis, whereas using the conventional chase protocol (1-min window) outside the respirometer increased this difference to 31\% (P {$<$} 0.01). Moreover, because peak \.MO2chase was 18\% higher (P {$<$} 0.05) than peak \.MO2rec, chasing a fish inside a static respirometer may be a better protocol for obtaining maximum \.MO2.},
