  abstract = {Temperature and oxygen limit the distribution of marine ectotherms. Haematological traits underlying bloodoxygen carrying capacity are thought to be correlated with thermal tolerance in certain fishes, and this relationship is hypothesised to be explained by oxygen supply capacity. We tested this hypothesis using reef shark neonates as experimental models because they live near their upper thermal limits and are physiologically sensitive to low oxygen conditions. We first described in situ associations between temperature and oxygen at the study site (Moorea, French Polynesia) and found that the habitats for reef shark neonates (Carcharhinus melanopterus and Negaprion acutidens) were hyperoxic at the maximum recorded temperatures. Next, we tested for in situ associations between thermal habitat characteristics and haematological traits of neonates. Contrary to predictions, we only demonstrated a negative association between haemoglobin concentration and maximum habitat temperatures in C. melanopterus. Next, we tested for ex situ associations between critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and haematological traits, but only demonstrated a negative association between haematocrit and CTMax in C. melanopterus. Finally, we measured critical oxygen tension (pcrit) ex situ and estimated its temperature sensitivity to predict oxygen-dependent values of CTMax. Estimated temperature sensitivity of pcrit was similar to reported values for sharks and skates, and predicted values for CTMax equalled maximum habitat temperatures.},

However, all prior investigations of metabolism in social cephalopods have utilized individual animals. We measured oxygen consumption of the social squid Doryteuthis opalescens both in groups and with solitary individuals to examine the influence of grouping on energy demand and performance under hypoxic conditions. On average, the presence of conspecifics reduced routine metabolic rate by 21\% but did not influence the critical oxygen partial pressure below which a stable rate of oxygen uptake is not maintained. In addition, displays of chromatic behaviors associated with relaxation were observed more frequently in groups, whereas behaviors associated with stress or vigilance were observed more frequently in solitary individuals. We hypothesize that through a potential reduction in energy consumption, grouping may be relevant in allowing social squids to exploit habitats with marginal oxygen availability that may impose a physiological constraint.},

  abstract = {The projected climate change and increase in thermal conditions in northern latitudes over the next 60 yr has the potential to alter the metabolic scope and potential fitness of aquatic ectotherms. Here, we experimentally tested if elevated egg incubation temperature affected metabolic scope in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) as a phenotypically plastic response. Cohorts of brown trout from anadromous and resident crosses were raised through embryogenesis in either natural river temperatures (cold) or elevated (+3\textdegree C, warm) temperatures until they could feed exogenously. The standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), and aerobic scope (AS = MMR - SMR) of juveniles from four anadromous-resident crosses and from both incubation temperatures were tested at 13\textdegree C. We found that metabolic measures (SMR, MMR, AS) were lower in warm than cold-incubated fish. There was no difference in the metabolic rates of fish from different anadromous-resident crosses. The results of this experiment are consistent with the countergradient variation hypothesis (CGV) in which phenotypic variation, in this case variation in metabolic rates, is inversely related to thermal conditions, originally proposed in relation to altitudinal or latitudinal gradients. While previous studies have related CGV to genetic differences between populations, our study shows that thermal differences encountered at the embryonic stage can produce a phenotypic pattern consistent with CGV. It is difficult to predict the consequences of these metabolic changes in a future warmer climate, as lower metabolic rates indicate that brown trout will probably expend less energy, but a reduced aerobic scope may counteract this affect, limiting their ability as a top predator and in escaping predators. Our results suggest that there are mechanisms used to adjust to elevated water temperature that can be initiated during embryogenesis. Given that there were no differences among crosses, it is likely that temperature-induced differences are the result of plastic responses.},

Here, we compare the response of a ubiquitous scleractinian coral, Stylophora pistillata, from the northern Red Sea to acute (7 h) and chronic (7\textendash 11 d) thermal stress events that include temperature treatments of 27 C (i.e., the local maximum monthly mean), 29.5 C, 32 C, and 34.5 C, and assess recovery of the corals following exposure. Overall, S. pistillata exhibited remarkably similar responses to acute and chronic thermal stress, responding primarily to the temperature treatment rather than duration or heating rate. Additionally, corals displayed an exceptionally high thermal tolerance, maintaining their physiological performance and suffering little to no loss of algal symbionts or chlorophyll a up to 32 C, before the host suffered from rapid tissue necrosis and mortality at 34.5 C. While there was some variability in physiological response metrics, photosynthetic efficiency measurements (i.e., maximum quantum yield Fv/Fm) accurately reflected the overall physiological response patterns, with these measurements used to produce the Fv/Fm effective dose (ED50) metric as a proxy for the thermal tolerance of corals. This approach produced similar ED50 values for the acute and chronic experiments (34.47 C vs. 33.81 C), highlighting the potential for acute thermal assays with measurements of Fv/Fm as a systematic and standardized approach to quantitively compare the upper thermal limits of reef-building corals using a portable experimental system.},

  abstract = {Rising temperatures are set to imperil freshwater fishes as climate change ensues unless compensatory strategies are employed. However, the presence of additional stressors, such as elevated nitrate concentrations, may affect the efficacy of compensatory responses. Here, juvenile silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) were exposed to current-day summer temperatures (28oC) or a future climate-warming scenario (32oC) and simultaneously exposed to one of three ecologically relevant nitrate concentrations (0, 50 or 100 mg L-1). We measured indicators of fish performance (growth, swimming), aerobic scope (AS) and upper thermal tolerance (CTMAX) to test the hypothesis that nitrate exposure would increase susceptibility to elevated temperatures and limit thermal compensatory responses. After 8 weeks of acclimation, the thermal sensitivity and plasticity of AS and swimming performance were tested at three test temperatures (28, 32, 36oC). The AS of 28oC-acclimated fish declined with increasing temperature, and the effect was more pronounced in nitrate exposed individuals. In these fish, declines in AS corresponded with poorer swimming performance and a 0.8oC decrease in CTMAX compared to unexposed fish. In contrast, acclimation to 32oC masked the effects of nitrate; fish acclimated to 32oC displayed a thermally insensitive phenotype whereby locomotor performance remained unchanged, AS was maintained and CTMAX was increased by \textasciitilde 1oC irrespective of nitrate treatment compared to fish acclimated to 28oC. Growth was however markedly reduced in 32oC-acclimated compared to 28oC-acclimated fish. Our results indicate that nitrate exposure increases the susceptibility of fish to acute high temperatures, but thermal compensation can override some of these potential detrimental effects.},

  abstract = {Ocean warming (OW) and acidification (OA) affects nearly all aspects of marine organism physiology and it is important to consider both stressors when predicting responses to climate change. We investigated the effects of long-term exposure to OW and OA on the physiology of adults of the sea urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma, a species resident in the southeast Australia warming hotspot. The urchins were slowly introduced to stressor conditions in the laboratory over a 7-week adjustment period to three temperature (ambient, +2{$\smwhtcircle$}C, +3{$\smwhtcircle$}C) and two pH (ambient: pHT 8.0; -0.4 units: pHT 7.6) treatments. They were then maintained in a natural pattern of seasonal temperature and photoperiod change, and fixed pH, for 22 weeks. Survival was monitored through week 22 and metabolic rate was measured at 4 and 12 weeks of acclimation, feeding rate and ammonia excretion rate at 12 weeks and assimilation efficiency at 13 weeks. Acclimation to +3{$\smwhtcircle$}C was deleterious regardless of pH. Mortality from week 6 indicated that recent marine heatwaves are likely to have been deleterious to this species. Acclimation to +2{$\smwhtcircle$}C did not affect survival. Increased temperature decreased feeding and increased excretion rates, with no effect of acidification. While metabolic rate increased additively with temperature and low pH at week 4, there was no difference between treatments at week 12, indicating physiological acclimation in surviving urchins to stressful conditions. Regardless of treatment, H. erythrogramma had a net positive energy budget indicating that the responses were not due to energy limitation. To test for the effect of parental acclimation on offspring responses, the offspring of acclimated urchins were reared to the juvenile stage in OW and OA conditions. Parental acclimation to warming, but not acidification altered juvenile physiology with an increase in metabolic rate. Our results show that incorporation of gradual seasonal environmental change in longterm acclimation can influence outcomes, an important consideration in predicting the consequences of changing climate for marine species.},

The large chain-forming diatom Biddulphia biddulphiana greatly increases in abundance as pCO2 increases along natural seawater CO2 gradients in the north Pacific Ocean. In areas with reference levels of pCO2, it was hard to find, but as seawater carbon dioxide levels rose, it replaced seaweeds and became the main habitat-forming species on the seabed. This diatom algal turf supported a marine invertebrate community that was much less diverse and completely differed from the benthic communities found at present-day levels of pCO2. Seawater CO2 enrichment stimulated the growth and photosynthetic efficiency of benthic diatoms, but reduced the abundance of calcified grazers such as gastropods and sea urchins. These observations suggest that ocean acidification will shift photic zone community composition so that coastal food-web structure and ecosystem function are homogenised, simplified, and more strongly affected by seasonal algal blooms.},

The study of metabolism in aquatic animals is undergoing an especially pronounced expansion, with more researchers utilising intermittent-flow respirometry as a research tool than ever before. Aquatic respirometry measures rate of oxygen uptake a proxy for metabolic rates and the intermittent-flow technique has numerous strengths for use with aquatic animals, allowing metabolic rate to be repeatedly estimated on individual animals over several hours or days and during exposure to various conditions or stimuli. There are, however, no published guidelines for reporting of methodological details when using this method. Here we provide the first guidelines for reporting intermittent-flow respirometry methods, in the form of a checklist of criteria that we consider to be the minimum required for the interpretation, evaluation and replication of experiments using intermittent-flow respirometry. Furthermore, using a survey of the existing literature, we show that there has been incomplete and inconsistent reporting of methods for intermittent-flow respirometry over the last several decades. Use of the provided checklist of required criteria by researchers when publishing their work should increase consistency of the reporting of methods for studies that use intermittent-flow respirometry. With the steep increase in studies using intermittent-flow respirometry, now is the ideal time to standardise reporting of methods, so that \textendash{} in the future \textendash{} data can be properly assessed by other scientists and conservationists.},

  abstract = {Plastic polymers have quickly become one of the most abundant materials on Earth due to their low production cost and high versatility. Unfortunately, some of the discarded plastic can make its way into the environment and become fragmented into smaller microscopic particles, termed secondary microplastics (MP). In addition, primary MP, purposely manufactured microscopic plastic particles, can also make their way into our environment via various routes. Owing to their size and resilience, these MP can then be easily ingested by living organisms. The effect of MP particles on living organisms is suspected to have negative implications, especially during early development. In this study, we examined the effects of polyethylene MP ingestion for four and ten days of exposure starting at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). In particular, we examined the effects of polyethylene MP exposure on resting metabolic rate, on gene expression of several inflammatory and oxidative stress linked genes, and on microbiome composition between treatments. Overall, we found no evidence of broad metabolic disturbances or inflammatory markers in MP-exposed fish for either period of time. However, there was a significant increase in the oxidative stress mediator L-FABP that occurred at 15 dpf. Furthermore, the microbiome was disrupted by MP exposure, with evidence of an increased abundance of Bacteroidetes in MP fish, a combination frequently found in intestinal pathologies. Thus, it appears that acute polyethylene MP exposure can increase oxidative stress and dysbiosis, which may render the animal more susceptible to diseases.},

Methods: Several studies, articles and reviews were included after literature research. The main questions of the research were: the most important and widely used physiological signals for stress detection/ assessment, the analysis methods for their manipulation and the implementation of signal analysis for stress detection/assessment in various developed systems. Findings: The main conclusion is that current researching approaches lead to more sophisticated methods of analysis and more accurate systems of stress detection and assessment.

This study is the first to test the effects of salmon faeces and inorganic sediment deposition on the photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and pigment content of the coralline alga Lithothamnion soriferum. In a 6 wk laboratory experiment, inorganic sediment and salmon faeces deposition significantly reduced the amount of light reaching the surface of coralline algae. No impact of inorganic sediment deposition was detected on L. soriferum physiology, while salmon faeces deposition increased respiration rate and reduced net primary production and calcification. The accumulation of salmon faeces stimulates proliferation of bacteria, with adverse consequences on L. soriferum physiology due to the potential release of toxic compounds. Burial by salmon faeces deposition also affects the physiology of coralline algae due to the flocculation of sticky faeces particles, which may limit nutrient and gas exchanges in the vicinity of thalli. Carbon dioxide accumulation in the vicinity of L. soriferum may lead to a decline in pH and alter the calcification process in cell walls. In natural maerl beds, the negative effect of faeces deposition may be exacerbated by longer-term exposure and the presence of other chemicals released by fish farms.},

We investigated the effects of ocean acidification ({$\increment$}pH = -0.4) on the oxygen consumption and morphometry during the early ontogeny of a commercially important seabream, Chrysoblephus laticeps, up until flexion. Hatchlings appeared to be tolerant to hypercapnic conditions, exhibiting no difference in oxygen consumption or morphometry between treatments, although the yolk reserves were marginally reduced in the low-pH treatment. The preflexion stages appeared to undergo metabolic depression, exhibiting lower metabolic rates along with lower growth metrics in hypercapnic conditions. However, although the sample sizes were low, the flexion-stage larvae exhibited greater rates of metabolic and growth metric increases in hypercapnic conditions. This study shows that the effects of OA may be stage specific during early ontogeny and potentially related to the development of crucial organs, such as the gills. Future studies investigating the effects of climate change on fish larvae should endeavour to include multiple developmental stages in order to make more accurate predictions on recruitment dynamics for the coming decades.},

So humans have to look for solutions to replace freshwater when use of it is not necessary. This also has an effect to aquaculture \textendash{} more and more farmers are farming freshwater fish in brackish water. Many authors have demonstrated the benefits of brackish water for fish growth and other physiological functions. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is valuable fish for its tolerance to high temperatures, salinity, low amount of dissolved oxygen. They are fairly easy to farm and the quality of the meat and the taste is good. But, despite all the qualities, farmers in Lithuania do not choose to farm these fish. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of brackish water on the efficiency of Nile tilapia aquaculture technology. To achieve the goal an experiment was conducted in the Laboratory of Fishery and Aquaculture of the Marine Research Institute of Klaipeda University on August 5 December 18, 2020. During it, three separate recirculating aquaculture systems were constructed from system B. One such system consisted of three tanks. Tank volume \textendash{} 2,83 m3. Total amount of biofilter filler \textendash{} 130 L, water inflow \textendash{} 36 L min-1. All tanks were equipped with the same bio and mechanical filters, oxygen diffusers, the room is heated by heaters. In the experiment water of three different salinities were used: fresh water (0\textperthousand ), water from the Baltic Sea (6\textperthousand ) and diluted sea water (3\textperthousand ). The remaining three basins are used as reserve tanks for storing and diluting seawater. Seawater is pumped to the laboratory from the shores of the Baltic Sea, and fresh water is obtained from a well. Nile tilapia were sorted and distributed into tanks. At the beginning of the study, the average fish weight was: 0\textperthousand{} \textendash{} 84,4 {$\pm$} 19,51 g, 3\textperthousand{} \textendash{} 81,28 {$\pm$} 22,31 g, 6\textperthousand{} \textendash{} 84,08 {$\pm$} 16.47 g, stocking density - 0\textperthousand{} \textendash{} 8,08 kg m-3, 3\textperthousand{} ir 6\textperthousand{} \textendash{} po 8,22 kg m 3. Fish were acclimatized for three weeks, their health and behavior were monitored. Water quality parameters were measured daily \textendash{} temperature (\textdegree C), dissolved oxygen content (\%), pH. Tests of water saples from each system were conducted to determine the amount of ammonium (NH4), nitrite (NO2) and nitrate (NO3) in the water. Dead fish were counted. During the experiment, approximately every three weeks, 30 fishes were randomly caught and measured from tank. Caught individuals were placed in plastic buckets filled with water. If present, juveniles were collected. Eggs and larvae were photographed, the amount was counted from the photo and fry was counted by transferring from one container to another. Counted juveniles were released into individual aquariums filled with water of appropriate salinity. Adult individuals were weighed, the total length (L) and the length to the caudal fin (l) were measured. During the last two measurements, the sex of the fish was determined according to the shape and size of the papilla and the urogenital organs. A toluidine blue solution diluted with distilled water was used for determination of gender. At the end of the experiment, the following were calculated: mean fish weight, specific growth rate (SGR), weight gain ({$\Delta$}w), feed conversion ratio (FCR), initial and final Fulton coefficients (Ki and Kf), final biomass, and survival. A respiration experiment was conducted using Nile tilapia juveniles to determine their metabolic rate (MO2). A PyroScience FireSting O2 optical oxygen meter was used for the respiration experiment. Experiment was conducted in two trials. First one: water of different salinity (0\textperthousand, 3\textperthousand, 6\textperthousand ) was added to each respirometry system, the water temperature was 22 \textdegree C. Juveniles from 0\textperthousand{} aquarium were placed in 0\textperthousand{} system, from 3\textperthousand{} to 3\textperthousand{} systems and from 6\textperthousand{} aquarium to 6\textperthousand{} system. Second trial: water of different salinity (0\textperthousand, 3\textperthousand, 6\textperthousand ) was added to each system, the water temperature was 23 \textdegree C., Juveniles from 0\textperthousand, 3\textperthousand{} and 6\textperthousand{} aquariums were placed in each system. Intermitted respirometry method were used: when the amount of oxygen dropped \textasciitilde{} 2 mg L-1 from the initial amount, the water was renewed \textendash{} the former water was poured out of the bottle and a new, well-oxygenated water was added. Fry in the bottles were not changed. After the experiment, the fry was weighed (g). A study of physico-chemical properties of fish meat was conducted. After the growth experiment, three females and three males were randomly transferred from each pool to the reservoirs of the system with water of appropriate salinity. A total of 54 tilapias were used in the study. Skinless fish fillets were used for the study, each piece was weighed. A total of 18 samples were taken, 6 from each system (3 females and 3 males). Due to the low weight of the female fillets, the samples were pooled \textendash{} one sample consisted of three fish using one half of their fillets. Samples were kept on ice until they reached the laboratory. The study of physico-chemical properties of meat was performed at the Veterinary Academy of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences. The percentage of protein, fat, ash, dry matter, water binding and water content of the sample was determined and the pH was determined. In this study were found that water salinity had a statistically significant effect on dissolved oxygen content, pH, and nitrite content in water. Also, due failed adaptation of freshwater recirculating aquaculture system to the brackish water, the water quality deteriorated during the study, especially in the 6 \textperthousand{} system, which affected other results. Growth and feed conversion ratios did not differ statistically significantly under different salinity conditions. The worst survival was in the 6 \textperthousand{} system due to deteriorating water quality during the study, and the best in the 0 \textperthousand{} system. Gender had a statistically significant effect on fish weight, with the final weight of males being 54\% higher than females. Brackish water conditions did not significantly affect the spawning of Nile tilapia females, larval and fry amount. There were also no statistically significant differences in the measurement of pup metabolic rate. When assessing meat quality, there was a statistically significant difference in meat pH and water content between systems. Water content in fish meat also differed statistically significantly between the sexes.},

  abstract = {In a natural ecosystem, fish are subjected to a multitude of variable environmental factors. It is important to analyze the impact of combined factors to obtain a realistic understanding of the mixed stress occurring in nature. In this study, the physiological performance of juvenile common carp (Cyprinus carpio) exposed for one week to an environmentally relevant metal mixture (4.8~{$\mu$}g/L of copper; 2.9~{$\mu$}g/L of cadmium and 206.8~{$\mu$}g/L of zinc) and to two temperatures (10~\textdegree C and 20~\textdegree C), were evaluated. After 1, 3 and 7~days, standard (SMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) were measured and aerobic scope (AS) was calculated. In addition, hematocrit, muscle lactate, histology of the gills and metal accumulation in gills were measured. While SMR, MMR and AS were elevated at the higher temperature, the metal mixture did not have a strong effect on these parameters. At 20~\textdegree C, SMR transiently increased, but no significant changes were observed for MMR and AS. During metal exposure, hematocrit levels were elevated in the 20~\textdegree C group. The bioaccumulation of Cd in the gills reflected the increased metabolic rate at the higher temperature, with more accumulation at 20~\textdegree C than at 10~\textdegree C. Anaerobic metabolism was not increased, which corresponds with the lack of significant histopathological damage in the gill tissue. These results show that common carp handled these metal exposures well, although increased temperature led to higher Cd accumulation and necessitated increased hematocrit levels to maintain aerobic performance.},

  abstract = {Advances in experimental design and equipment have simplified the collection of maximum metabolic rate (MMR) data for a more diverse array of water-\-breathing animals. However, little attention has been given to the consequences of analytical choices in the estimation of MMR. Using different analytical methods can reduce the comparability of MMR estimates across species and studies and has consequences for the burgeoning number of macroecological meta-\-analyses using metabolic rate data. Two key analytical choices that require standardization are the time interval, or regression window width, over which MMR is estimated, and the method used to locate that regression window within the raw oxygen depletion trace. Here, we consider the effect of both choices by estimating MMR for two shark and two salmonid species of different activity levels using multiple regression window widths and three analytical methods: rolling regression, sequential regression, and segmented regression. Shorter regression windows yielded higher metabolic rate estimates, with a risk that the shortest windows ({$<$}1-\-min) reflect more system noise than MMR signal. Rolling regression was the best candidate model and produced the highest MMR estimates. Sequential regression models consistently produced lower relative estimates than rolling regression models, while the segmented regression model was unable to produce consistent MMR estimates across individuals. The time-\-point of the MMR regression window along the oxygen consumption trace varied considerably across individuals but not across models. We show that choice of analytical method, in addition to more widely understood experimental choices, profoundly affect the resultant estimates of MMR. We recommend that researchers (1) employ a rolling regression model with a reliable regression window tailored to their experimental system and (2) explicitly report their analytical methods, including publishing raw data and code.},

  abstract = {Species persistence in a changing world will depend on how they cope with co-occurring stressors. Stressors can interact in unanticipated ways, where exposure to one stressor may heighten or reduce resilience to another stressor. We examined how a leading threat to aquatic species, nitrate pollution, affects susceptibility to hypoxia and heat stress in a salmonid, the European grayling (Thymallus thymallus). Fish were exposed to nitrate pollution (0, 50 or 200 mg NO3- L-1) at two acclimation temperatures (18 \textdegree C or 22 \textdegree C) for eight weeks. Hypoxia- and heattolerance were subsequently assessed, and the gills of a subset of fish were sampled for histological analyses. Nitrate-exposed fish were significantly more susceptible to acute hypoxia at both acclimation temperatures. Similarly, in 18 \textdegree C- acclimated fish, exposure to 200 mg NO3- L- 1 caused a 1 \textdegree C decrease in heat tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax). However, the opposite effect was observed in 22 \textdegree C-acclimated fish, where nitrate exposure increased heat tolerance by \textasciitilde 1 \textdegree C. Further, nitrate exposure induced some histopathological changes to the gills, which limit oxygen uptake. Our findings show that nitrate pollution can heighten the susceptibility of fish to additional threats in their habitat, but interactions are temperature dependent.},

  abstract = {The invasiveness of Corbicula largillierti has been underestimated, but this bivalve is currently receiving more attention. The first study of the distribution of this species along one of the major basins of central Argentina showed that it was completely absent in the major central reservoir, but was present along its tributary and effluent rivers. Ten years later, this discontinuous distribution has not changed, despite the bivalve's high dispersion capacity. The main environmental differences between the reservoir and the rivers are that the former has finer sediment grain size, higher temperatures, and lower oxygen concentration during summer months. This study aimed to evaluate whether one of these factors could be limiting the distribution of C. largillierti. We assessed the metabolic response and burial behavior (under different grain sizes) of C. largillierti over 8 weeks at 30\textdegree C against a control condition at 20\textdegree C. We also analyzed the oxygen consumption (vO2) as a function of environmental oxygen concentration (pO2) at 25\textdegree C, estimating its metabolic regulation capacity (R). This showed the existence of an environmental oxygen concentration threshold (Pt) that could be an indicative of physiological limiting concentrations that compromise species survival and settlement. After 8 weeks at 30\textdegree C, the metabolic rate of individuals of C. largillierti increased and their burial behavior was slightly compromised but mostly for coarser sediments. Concerning environmental oxygen availability, C. largillierti is an oxyconformer with a low R (39.9\%), a clear pattern of negative regulation, and a low Pt (48.4\% air saturation). The lack of any regulation capacity of C. largillierti under environmental oxygen limitations and the extremely low pO2 at the bottom of the reservoir during summer months may explain its failure to colonize and survive there.},

We compare their physi\- ological responses to hyposalinity stress under suboptimal low and high temperature, while inferring on hypoxia tolerance. We use an energy-redox approach, analyzing mortality rate, the energetic balance and the consequent effects on the oxidative homeostasis. We found that decreased seawater salinity and/or oxygen levels can weaken biotic resistance, especially in females of C. equilibra, leading to periods of heightened vulnerability to invasion. Our approach provides mechanistic insights towards understanding the factors promoting invader impacts, highlighting the potential of ecophysiology for improving invasive species management.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The proliferation of sea urchins can decimate macroalgal forests in coastal ecosystems, leading to persistent barren seascapes. While kelp forests are among the most productive ecosystems on the planet, productivity in these urchin barrens is dramatically reduced. Moreover, urchins inhabiting these food-depauperate barrens face starvation and many survive in these barrens for years or decades. Urchins in barrens can persist by eating food subsidies from drift algae, pelagic salps, tubeworms, as well as encrusting and filamentous algae, microbial mats, and slow-growing species resistant to herbivory. Despite both food from endogenous production and exogenous subsidies, many urchins in barrens likely experience prolonged food deprivation. This resource limitation may create a trade-off between reproduction and survival; for example, fecundity of purple sea urchins (\emph{Strongylocentrotus purpuratus}) is 99.9\% lower in barrens. Despite food constraints, red sea urchins (\emph{Mesocentrotus franciscanus}), the dominant urchin species at our study sites, can live in excess of 100 years and barrens in Haida Gwaii, British Columbia (BC), Canada, have persisted for at least 143 years. While these phenomena are widespread and well documented, the bioenergetic adaptations that allow urchins to persist in these food-depauperate barrens remain poorly understood. To quantify habitat-specific differences in metabolic rates and energy reserves (as measured by gonadal mass), we conducted respirometry on and measured gonadal mass in \emph{M. franciscanus} at three locations in BC inside and outside of adjacent kelp forest and barrens habitat. Here we demonstrate that \emph{M. franciscanus} in barrens versus kelp forests have substantially lower energy reserves and, importantly, also exhibit dramatic reductions in size-specific resting metabolic rates (RMR), even after standardizing by metabolically active body mass. On average, gonadal mass was 44.6\% lower and RMR scaled to metabolically active body mass was 40\% lower in barrens urchins than in kelp forest urchins. Such a shift in metabolic rate may provide a mechanism that facilitates barren state stability over long time scales as \emph{M. franciscanus} can lower energetic demands while they wait for small pulses of food, scrape by on low-productivity resources, and suppress recruitment of macroalgae for months, years, or decades.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A possible, but rarely considered mechanism is that metabolic response of ectotherms to warming associate with changes in brain morphology and functioning. Here we compared aerobic metabolism, volume of brain, boldness, and accuracy of maze solving of common minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) acclimated for eight months to either their current optimal natural (14 \textdegree C) or warm (20 \textdegree C) water temperature. Metabolic rates indicated increased energy expenditure in warm acclimated fish, but also at least partial thermal compensation as warm acclimate fish maintained high aerobic scope. Warm acclimated fish had larger brain than cool acclimated fish. Volume of dorsal medulla relative to the overall brain size was larger in warm than cool acclimated fish, but proportion of other brain regions did not differ between the temperature treatments. Warm acclimated fish did not differ in boldness but did more errors than cool acclimated fish in exploring the maze across four trials. Inter-individual differences in numbers of exploration errors were repeatable across the four trials of the maze test. Our findings suggest that in warm environments, maintaining a high aerobic scope which is important for the performance of physically demanding tasks, can come at the cost of changes in brain morphology and impairment of the capacity to explore novel environments. This trade-off could have strong fitness implications for wild ectotherms.},

  abstract = {This study hypothesized that oxygen uptake (\.MO2) measured with a novel protocol of chasing rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss to exhaustion inside a static respirometer while simultaneously monitoring \.MO2 (\.MO2chase) would generate the same and repeatable peak value as when peak active \.MO2 (\.MO2active) is measured in a critical swimming speed protocol. To reliably determine peak \.MO2chase, and compare to the peak during recovery of \.MO2 after a conventional chase protocol outside the respirometer (\.MO2rec), this study applied an iterative algorithm and a minimum sampling window duration (i.e., 1 min based on an analysis of the variance in background and exercise \.MO2) to account for \.MO2 dynamics. In support of this hypothesis, peak \.MO2active (707 {$\pm$} 33 mg O2 h-1 kg-1) and peak \.MO2chase (663 {$\pm$} 43 mg O2 h-1 kg-1) were similar (P = 0.49) and repeatable (Pearson's and Spearman's correlation test; r {$\geq$} 0.77; P {$<$} 0.05) when measured in the same fish. Therefore, estimates of \.MO2max can be independent of whether a fish is exhaustively chased inside a respirometer or swum to fatigue in a swim tunnel, provided \.MO2 is analysed with an iterative algorithm and a minimum but reliable sampling window. The importance of using this analytical approach was illustrated by peak \.MO2chase being 23\% higher (P {$<$} 0.05) when compared with a conventional sequential interval regression analysis, whereas using the conventional chase protocol (1-min window) outside the respirometer increased this difference to 31\% (P {$<$} 0.01). Moreover, because peak \.MO2chase was 18\% higher (P {$<$} 0.05) than peak \.MO2rec, chasing a fish inside a static respirometer may be a better protocol for obtaining maximum \.MO2.},
