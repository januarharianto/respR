\[Cool package name]\ is a **respiration analysis package** for the R programming environment. The package should, once properly coded, be able to measure *any* kind of data that looks at rate of change, but for the programmers' purposes we are focusing on **the rate of change of oxygen consumption over time** only. At least for version 1.0.

### To-do

This will update frequently, but the initial, big-picture, to-do list:

- [x] Upload files to Github before we lose track of everything
- [x] Write an initial README just to motivate ourselves (and set expectations)
- [ ] Write function for conversion between cO~2~ units
- [ ] Create inputs: Â°C, salinity, atm pressure, etc., ideally at the beginning (and not have to deal with it later)
- [ ] function for getting running uptake rate for long term data
- [ ] function for pCrit.
- [ ] calculate running lm's of width n.
- [ ] identify region of max slope changes?
- [ ] Sensitivity thresholds.
- [ ] Maybe inset plot for lmmethod to show fit of the lm more clearly
