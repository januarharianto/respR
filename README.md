\[Cool package name] is a **respiration analysis package** for the R programming environment.

As of now it is simply a series of scripts. The aim is to package everything into a SHINY interface.

### Usage

The package focuses on the analysis of respiration data. Such data is often recorded as a rate of change of oxygen consumption, over time. The user will be able to easily select data points to run a simple linear regression. The traditional before-after calculation method will also be provided.

> Once we have the interface up and running, we will include examples here.

### To-do

This will update frequently, but the initial to-do list:

- [x] Upload files to Github before we lose track of everything
- [x] Write an initial README just to motivate ourselves (and set expectations)
- [ ] Write function for conversion between cO~2~ units
- [ ] Create inputs: Â°C, salinity, atm pressure, etc., ideally at the beginning (and not have to deal with it later)
- [ ] function for getting running uptake rate for long term data
- [ ] function for pCrit.
- [ ] calculate running lm's of width n.
- [ ] identify region of max slope changes?
- [ ] Sensitivity thresholds.
- [ ] Maybe inset plot for lmmethod to show fit of the lm more clearly.
- [ ] SHINY implementation

### Instructions

Documentetion will go here - maybe a CRAN link as well, will discuss (focus on finalising script).

1. Install RStudio.
