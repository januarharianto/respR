# Welcome

**RespR** is an R package that consists of a collection of functions that provide a structured workflow for the analysis of respirometry-related data.


## Installation
You should install the stable version from CRAN (recommended):

    install.packages("respR")

Otherwise, use the `devtools` package to grab the developmental version from here:

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("januarharianto/respR")


## Usage
We have prepared a series of vignettes that can help you get up to speed with the package based on user case scenarios.

A good place to start is the introductory vignette, [respR - An R package for processing respirometry data](https://januarharianto.github.io/respR/). Other vignettes are linked to this one, and provided below for your convenience:

1. [Intermittent data](https://januarharianto.github.io/respR/intermittent.html).
2. [Maximum, minimum and interval analyses](https://github.com/januarharianto/respr).
3. [Running pcrit analyses](https://github.com/januarharianto/respr).
