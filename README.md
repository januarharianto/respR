# Welcome

`respR` is an R package that provides a structural, reproducible workflow for the processing and analysis of respirometry data. 
While the focus of our package is on aquatic respirometry, `respR` is largely unitless and so can process linear relationships in any time-series data, such as oxygen flux or photosynthesis.

[**This site**](https://januarharianto.github.io/respR/articles/respR.html) can show you how to get started, and has a range of vignettes covering the fuctionality of the package and example analyses for different respirometry experiment types. 

The package has also been [**peer reviewed and published**](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13162) in *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*. Please cite this publication if you use `respR` in your published work. If you don't have the space, or feel you haven't used it enough to justify citing it, not a problem at all, but please do [**let us know**](mailto:nicholascarey@gmail.com) anyway. We would like to keep track of studies which have found it useful, and we will help publicise your research. 

## Installation
`respR` will be submitted soon to CRAN. For now, use the `devtools` package to install the latest stable version:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("januarharianto/respR")
```

## Usage

For a quick evaluation of the package, try out the following code:

```r
library(respR) # load the library

# As lazy loading is in place, we do not need to call example data explicitly.
# This example will use the `urchins.rd` example data.

# 1. check data for errors, select cols 1 and 15:
urch <- inspect(urchins.rd, 1, 15) 
# 2. automatically determine linear segment:
rate <- auto_rate(urch)
# 3. convert units
out <- convert_rate(rate, "mg/l", "s", "mg/h/kg", 0.6, 0.4)

## Alternatively, use dplyr pipes:
urchins.rd %>%        # using the urchins dataset,
  select(1, 15) %>%   # select columns 1 and 15
  inspect()     %>%   # inspect the data, then
  auto_rate()   %>%   # automatically determine most linear segment
  print()       %>%   # just a quick preview
  convert_rate("mg/l", "s", "mg/h/kg", 0.6, 0.4) # convert units
  
```
