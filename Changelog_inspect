Changes

- `time = 1` and `oxygen = 2` the defaults rather than NULL
- if `oxygen = NULL` now inspects ALL columns
- added `width` input for rolling reg plot (default 0.1)
- updated roxygen docs. There was quite a lot out of date...
- Added message if multiple columns inspected that subsequent functions will only use first 2 by default
- Muliple rate inspection plot improved. Now all plot on same axes ranges, better colours and spacing.
- FIX: Rolling rate plot failed with even a single NA in time or oxygen data.

print.inspect
- minor edits to console print out (e.g. messages print relevant columns names rather than both x/y col names, better spacing)
- if uneven time, now prints min/max intervals found
- time error locations now printed out when multiple o2 columns inspected
