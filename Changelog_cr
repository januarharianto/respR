Changelog

unit_args
- updated with more detail of which functions accept which units

convert_rate
- NEW: now converts to surface area-specific rates via the 'area' argument.
- This acccepts 4 inputs: mm2, cm2, m2, km2

- Changed o2.unit = NULL and time.unit = NULL behaviour - now stops instead of applying a default.
- Now applies a default output unit for mass- and area specific rates as well as absolute.

convert_DO
- Removed ability to accept objects of class `calc_rate`, `auto_rate` or `adjust_rate`. This didn't make any sense in this function as rates are not a DO measure! However - a rate conversion would be very useful
