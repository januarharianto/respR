Changelog


convert_rate
- NEW: now converts to surface area-specific rates via the 'area' argument (acccepts 4 inputs: mm2, cm2, m2, km2)
- o2.unit = NULL and time.unit = NULL now stop instead of applying a default unit
- However, it now applies a default output unit for mass- and area specific rates as well as absolute.
- $output.unit oxygen amount component now has "O2" appended. e.g. mgO2/h/g, umolO2/day/m2 (done at end, does not affect any conversions).
- time - can now import data and output rates using 'day' as time unit e.g. "mgO2/day/m2"
- oxygen - can now output oxygen used in moles e.g. "molO2/day/kg"

unit_args
- updated with more detail of which functions accept which units

convert_DO
- Removed ability to accept objects of class `calc_rate`, `auto_rate` or `adjust_rate`. This didn't make any sense in this function as rates are not a DO measure! However - a rate conversion function would be very useful
