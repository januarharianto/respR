	abstract = {Expansion of oxygen deficient waters (hypoxia) in the northeast Pacific Ocean (NEP) will have marked impacts on marine life. The response of the resident communities will be a function of their ecophysiological constraints in low oxygen, although this remains untested in the NEP due to a lack of integrative studies. Here, we combine in situ surveys and lab-based respirometry experiments were conducted on three indicator species (spot prawn Pandalus platyceros, slender sole Lyopsetta exilis, squat lobster Munida quadrispina) of season- ally hypoxic systems in the NEP to test if metabolic constraints determine distributions and energy sequestra- tion in a hypoxic setting. These experiments were integrated with a global review of critical oxygen levels (Ocrit; lower threshold of aerobic metabolism) for crustaceans to determine if Ocrit-based hypoxia thresholds are 22 different among ocean basins. Our results show that species-specific differences in Ocrit and standard metabolic 2 rates (1) determine the lowest environmental oxygen ([O2]env) at which in situ populations occur, (2) result in disproportionate shifts in distributions among co-occurring species during summer hypoxia expansion events, and (3) characterize shifts in megafaunal community respiration rates due to marked spatio-temporal variabili- ty in [O ] . Our results show that Ocrit-based hypoxia thresholds are significantly lower in the East Pacific 2 env 2 Ocean relative to other major ocean basins, which suggests that the physiological response of local fauna to deoxygenation can be determined by the natural variability and oxygen exposure in a region. In order to establish realistic predictions on the biological consequences of marine deoxygenation, we suggest integrating metabolism-based traits to calculate hypoxia thresholds for marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Body-size and temperature are the major factors explaining metabolic rate, and the additional factor of pH is a major driver at the biochemical level. These three factors have frequently been found to interact, complicating the formulation of broad models predicting metabolic rates and hence ecological functioning. In this first study of the effects of warming and ocean acidification, and their potential interaction, on metabolic rate across a broad body-size range (two-to-three orders of magnitude difference in body mass) we addressed the impact of climate change on the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma in context with climate projections for east Australia, an ocean warming hotspot. Urchins were gradually introduced to two temperatures (18 and 23 °C) and two pH (7.5 and 8.0), and maintained for two months. That a new physiological steady-state had been reached, otherwise know as acclimation, was validated through identical experimental trials separated by several weeks. The relationship between body-size, temperature and acidification on the metabolic rate of H. erythrogramma was strikingly stable. Both stressors caused increases in metabolic rate; 20\% for temperature and 19\% for pH. Combined effects were additive; a 44\% increase in metabolism. Body-size had a highly stable relationship with metabolic rate regardless of temperature or pH. None of these diverse drivers of metabolism interacted or modulated the effects of the others, highlighting the partitioned nature of how each influences metabolic rate, and the importance of achieving a full acclimation state. Despite these increases in energetic demand there was very limited capacity for compensatory modulating of feeding rate; food consumption increased only in the very smallest specimens, and only in response to temperature, and not pH. Our data show that warming, acidification and body-size all substantially affect metabolism and are highly consistent and partitioned in their effects, and for H. erythrogramma near-future climate change will incur a substantial energetic cost.},

Measured parameters with representative rates of assimilation efficiency were used to calculate scope for growth (SfG) for each treatment. All physiological parameters were negatively affected at 24 ??C, showing a decrease in feeding rate which coincided with negative growth and gonad development at the end of the acclimation period, and a decrease in respiration rate suggesting metabolic depression. Histology of gonad samples after the acclimation period also showed no gametic material in animals acclimated at 24 ??C. All animals acclimated at 24 ??C had negative growth, differing from the calculated SfG which indicated that the animals had sufficient energy for production. The results suggest that calculated SfG in echinoderms should be used together with actual measurements of growth in individuals as, by itself, SfG may underestimate the actual effect of ocean warming when animals are exposed to stressful conditions. Overall, considering the total loss of reproductive output observed in E. chloroticus at higher temperatures, an increase in seawater temperature could dramatically influence the persistence of northern populations of this species, leading to flow-on effects in the subtidal ecosystem.},

Biochemical Adaptation: Mechanisms and Process in Physiological Evolution asks two primary questions. First, how have the core biochemical systems found in all species been adaptively modified to allow the same fundamental types of physiological processes to be sustained throughout the wide range of habitat conditions found in the biosphere? Second, through what types of genetic and biochemical processes have new physiological functions been fabricated? The primary audience for this book is faculty, senior undergraduates, and graduate students in environmental biology, comparative physiology, and marine biology.

We characterized the temperature and pH/pCO 2 conditions in the mid-intertidal, rocky-shore habitat of this species and used these data along with projections for the ocean over coming decades to define treatments in oxygen consumption experiments. The metabolic response of P. exigua to warming and acidification was dominated by temperature as the most significant factor influencing oxygen consumption. When P. exigua were exposed to intermediate pH/pCO 2 (7.8 /750ppm) levels combined with pulses of warming occasionally experienced in nature (6??C above sea surface temperature), the effect of temperature on metabolism was diminished. Our results show that the metabolic response of P. exigua is resilient to current levels of stress, but may be vulnerable in the future to the interactive effects of ocean warming and acidification at levels expected under near-future climate change. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The physiological mechanisms limiting and adjusting cold and heat tolerance have regained interest in the light of global warming and associated shifts in the geographical distribution of ectothermic animals. Recent comparative studies, largely carried out on marine ectotherms, indicate that the processes and limits of thermal tolerance are linked with the adjustment of aerobic scope and capacity of the whole animal as a crucial step in thermal adaptation on top of parallel adjustments at the molecular or membrane level. In accordance with Shelford's law of tolerance decreasing whole animal aerobic scope characterises the onset of thermal limitation at low and high pejus thresholds (pejus = getting worse). The drop in aerobic scope of an animal indicated by falling oxygen levels in the body fluids and or the progressively limited capacity of circulatory and ventilatory mechanisms. At high temperatures, excessive oxygen demand causes insufficient oxygen levels in the body fluids, whereas at low temperatures the aerobic capacity of mitochondria may become limiting for ventilation and circulation. Further cooling or warming beyond these limits leads to low or high critical threshold temperatures (Tc) where aerobic scope disappears and transition to an anaerobic mode of mitochondrial metabolism and progressive insufficiency of cellular energy levels occurs. The adjustments of mitochondrial densities and their functional properties appear as a critical process in defining and shifting thermal tolerance windows. The finding of an oxygen limited thermal tolerance owing to loss of aerobic scope is in line with Taylor's and Weibel's concept of symmorphosis, which implies that excess capacity of any component of the oxygen delivery system is avoided. The present study suggests that the capacity of oxygen delivery is set to a level just sufficient to meet maximum oxygen demand between the average highs and lows of environmental temperatures. At more extreme temperatures only time limited passive survival is supported by anaerobic metabolism or the protection of molecular functions by heat shock proteins and antioxidative defence. As a corollary, the first line of thermal sensitivity is due to capacity limitations at a high level of organisational complexity, i.e. the integrated function of the oxygen delivery system, before individual, molecular or membrane functions become disturbed. These interpretations are in line with the more general consideration that, as a result of the high level of complexity of metazoan organisms compared with simple eukaryotes and then prokaryotes, thermal tolerance is reduced in metazoans. A similar sequence of sensitivities prevails within the metazoan organism, with the highest sensitivity at the organismic level and wider tolerance windows at lower levels of complexity. However, the situation is different in that loss in aerobic scope and progressive hypoxia at the organismic level define the onset of thermal limitation which then transfers to lower hierarchical levels and causes cellular and molecular disturbances. Oxygen limitation contributes to oxidative stress and, finally, denaturation or malfunction of molecular repair, e.g. during suspension of protein synthesis. The sequence of thermal tolerance limits turns into a hierarchy, ranging from systemic to cellular to molecular levels. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

A growing body of evidence is showing that ocean acidification impacts growth and developmental rates of marine invertebrates. Here we test the impact of elevated seawater pCO 2 (129Pa, 1271μatm) on early development, larval metabolic and feeding rates in a marine model organism, the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Growth and development was assessed by measuring total body length, body rod length, postoral rod length and posterolateral rod length. Comparing these parameters between treatments suggests that larvae suffer from a developmental delay (by ca. 8\%) rather than from the previously postulated reductions in size at comparable developmental stages. Further, we found maximum increases in respiration rates of +100\% under elevated pCO 2, while body length corrected feeding rates did not differ between larvae from both treatments. Calculating scope for growth illustrates that larvae raised under high pCO 2 spent an average of 39 to 45\% of the available energy for somatic growth, while control larvae could allocate between 78 and 80\% of the available energy into growth processes. Our results highlight the importance of defining a standard frame of reference when comparing a given parameter between treatments, as observed differences can be easily due to comparison of different larval ages with their specific set of biological characters. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

BMR is one of the most widely measured physiological traits, and data are available for over 1,200 species. With data available for such a wide range of species, BMR is a benchmark measurement in ecological and evolutionary physiology, and is often used as a reference against which other levels of metabolism are compared. Implicit in such comparisons is the assumption that BMR is invariant for a given species and that it therefore represents a stable point of comparison. However, BMR shows substantial variation between individuals, populations and species. Investigation of the ultimate (evolutionary) explanations for these differences remains an active area of inquiry, and explanation of size-related trends remains a contentious area. Whereas explanations for the scaling of BMR are generally mechanistic and claim ties to the first principles of chemistry and physics, investigations of mass-independent variation typically take an evolutionary perspective and have demonstrated that BMR is ultimately linked with a range of extrinsic variables including diet, habitat temperature, and net primary productivity. Here we review explanations for size-related and mass-independent variation in the BMR of animals, and suggest ways that the various explanations can be evaluated and integrated.},

Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics.

Here, we analyse metabolic rates in diverse marine taxa, with special emphasis on patterns of metabolic rate across a depth gradient, in an effort to understand the extent and underlying causes of variation. The conclusion from this analysis is that low rates of metabolism, in the deep sea and elsewhere, do not result from resource (e.g. food or oxygen) limitation or from temperature or pressure constraint. While metabolic rates do decline strongly with depth in several important animal groups, for others metabolism in abyssal species proceeds as fast as in ecologically similar shallow-water species at equivalent temperatures. Rather, high metabolic demand follows strong selection for locomotory capacity among visual predators inhabiting well-lit oceanic waters. Relaxation of this selection where visual predation is limited provides an opportunity for reduced energy expenditure. Large-scale metabolic variation in the ocean results from interspecific differences in ecological energy demand.},

	abstract = {It has recently been suggested that general rules of change in ecological communities might be found through the development of functional relationships between species traits and performance. The physiological, behavioural and life-history traits of fishes are often organised along a fast-slow lifestyle continuum (FSLC). With respect to resistance (capacity for population to resist change) and resilience (capacity for population to recover from change) to environmental hypoxia, the literature suggests that traits enhancing resilience may come at the expense of traits promoting resistance to hypoxia; a trade-off may exist. Here I test whether three fishes occupying different positions along the FSLC trade-off resistance and resilience to environmental hypoxia. Static respirometry experiments were used to determine resistance, as measured by critical oxygen tension (Pcrit), and capacity for (RC) and magnitude of metabolic reduction (RM). Swimming respirometry experiments were used to determine aspects of resilience: critical (Ucrit) and optimal swimming speed (Uopt), and optimal cost of transport (COTopt). Results pertaining to metabolic reduction suggest a resistance gradient across species described by the inequality Melanotaenia fluviatilis (fast lifestyle) {\textless} Hypseleotris sp.

However, the scope of inferences that can be drawn from an individual study is narrow, and so steps towards general, trait-based rules of fish community change along environmental gradients are discussed.},

	abstract = {A new experimental and analytical protocol enabling the measurement of the metabolism of aquatic communities in open-top mesocosms is described. It involves estimation of air-water gas exchange and use of a polynomial regression to estimate metabolic parameters from measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration. Sample data is provided for a coral reef community. Its major advantage compared to the standard respirometry technique is that the community is not subject to great variations of physical and chemical parameters such as dissolved oxygen concentration or pH during the experiment. Changes in the concentration of dissolved oxygen were measured over 24 h periods and used to derive community gross photosynthesis (Pg) and respiration (R). Experiments performed on the same community with 2 differents light intensities (360 and 250 μmol m–2 s–1) provided consistent estimates of Pg (208 ± 50 and 73 ± 20 mmol O2 m–2 d–1) and R (–219 ± 55 and –79 ± 29 mmol O2 m–2 d–1). The air-water oxygen transfer velocities, \$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{2\}\}\$, varied between 34 ± 5 and 84 ± 12 cm h–1. This approach provided estimates of community metabolism that are not significantly different from those obtained using the standard respirometry technique.},

	abstract = {Closed-system respirometry is a standard technique used to determine aerobic metabolism of aquatic organisms. Open-top systems are rarely used due to concerns of gas exchange across the air–water interface. Here, we evaluated an open-top respirometry system by comparing the mass-specific routine metabolic rate (RMR) of the tropical diadromous finfish barramundi, Lates calcarifer, in both closed-top and open-top respirometers. The RMR of 190 g barramundi was determined across broad temperatures ranging from 18 to 38 °C. There was no significant difference in RMR between barramundi in either closed- or open-top respirometers at any temperature (p {\textgreater} 0.05). To ensure RMR measurements were not an artifact of the respirometry system, barramundi were reciprocally transplanted into either respective closed-top or open-top respirometer and oxygen consumption re-measured at each temperature treatment. The RMR of transplanted barramundi was found to be virtually identical in either respirometer. RMR increased linearly with increasing temperature; the relationship between RMR and temperature (T; 18–38 °C) can be described as 3.658T−36.294 mg O2 kg−0.8 h−1. The daily energetic cost of RMR was 1.193T−11.838 kJ kg−0.8 day−1. Q10 for barramundi increased significantly with increasing temperature (p {\textless} 0.0001). Q10(18–28) was the lowest at 1.7 and Q10(28–38) the highest at 1.9, over the whole experiment temp range Q10(18–28) was 1.8. The current study demonstrates that open-top respirometry is a reliable and practical alternative to closed-top respirometry for accurate determination of the aerobic metabolism of barramundi and has potential application for a number of different aquatic organisms.},

	abstract = {Hypoxia is a common occurrence in aquatic habitats, and it is becoming an increasingly frequent and widespread environmental perturbation, primarily as the result of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment and climate change. An in-depth understanding of the hypoxia tolerance of fishes, and how this varies among individuals and species, is required to make accurate predictions of future ecological impacts and to provide better information for conservation and fisheries management. The critical oxygen level (Pcrit) has been widely used as a quantifiable trait of hypoxia tolerance. It is defined as the oxygen level below which the animal can no longer maintain a stable rate of oxygen uptake (oxyregulate) and uptake becomes dependent on ambient oxygen availability (the animal transitions to oxyconforming). A comprehensive database of Pcrit values, comprising 331 measurements from 96 published studies, covering 151 fish species from 58 families, provides the most extensive and up-to-date analysis of hypoxia tolerance in teleosts. Methodologies for determining Pcrit are critically examined to evaluate its usefulness as an indicator of hypoxia tolerance in fishes. Various abiotic and biotic factors that interact with hypoxia are analysed for their effect on Pcrit, including temperature, CO2, acidification, toxic metals and feeding. Salinity, temperature, body mass and routine metabolic rate were strongly correlated with Pcrit; 20\% of variation in the Pcrit data set was explained by these four variables. An important methodological issue not previously considered is the inconsistent increase in partial pressure of CO2 within a closed respirometer during the measurement of Pcrit. Modelling suggests that the final partial pressure of CO2 reached can vary from 650 to 3500 µatm depending on the ambient pH and salinity, with potentially major effects on blood acid–base balance and Pcrit itself. This database will form part of a widely accessible repository of physiological trait data that will serve as a resource to facilitate future studies of fish ecology, conservation and management.},

In this study, we assessed the extent of intraspecific variation in metabolic rate within a group of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) and tested whether the observed variation in residual (body-mass-corrected) SMR, MMR, and absolute aerobic scope could be explained by variations in the residual size (mass) of metabolically active internal organs. Residual SMR was found to correlate positively with residual MMR, indicating a link between these two metabolic parameters, but no relationship between organ mass and metabolic rate was found for liver, heart, spleen, intestine, or stomach. Instead, activity in the liver of two aerobic mitochondrial enzymes, cytochrome c oxidase and, to a lesser extent, citrate synthase, was found to correlate with whole-animal metabolic rate, indicating that causes for intraspecific variation in the metabolic rate of fish can be found at a lower organizational level than organ size.},

	abstract = {Variability in metabolic scaling in animals, the relationship between metabolic rate (R) and body mass (M), has been a source of debate and controversy for decades. R is proportional to Mb, the precise value of b much debated, but historically considered equal in all organisms. Recent metabolic theory, however, predicts b to vary among species with ecology and metabolic level, and may also vary within species under different abiotic conditions. Under climate change, most species will experience increased temperatures, and marine organisms will experience the additional stressor of decreased seawater pH (‘ocean acidification’). Responses to these environmental changes are modulated by myriad species-specific factors. Body-size is a fundamental biological parameter, but its modulating role is relatively unexplored. Here, we show that changes to metabolic scaling reveal asymmetric responses to stressors across body-size ranges; b is systematically decreased under increasing temperature in three grazing molluscs, indicating smaller individuals were more responsive to warming. Larger individuals were, however, more responsive to reduced seawater pH in low temperatures. These alterations to the allometry of metabolism highlight abiotic control of metabolic scaling, and indicate that responses to climate warming and ocean acidification may be modulated by body-size.},

	abstract = {The impact of temperature on oxygen consumption (MO2) of Pandalus borealis was measured in the laboratory for juvenile, male and female shrimp at 2, 5 and 8 °C, the temperature range where P. borealis is generally found in the Northwest Atlantic. Measurements of MO2 were taken every 60 min over 7–10 days on 0.22 to 13.80 g shrimp. These long-term measurement periods insured acclimation to the respirometers and allowed calculation of standard metabolic rate of individuals (SMRind). SMRind was linearly related to body mass (log transformed data) and the mass-exponent for the species was 0.56. The effects of wet body mass (Ww) and temperature (T) on SMRind were described by: SMRind=10(0.57 log (Ww)+0.04 T−1.21), with SMRind expressed in mg O2 h−1, Ww in g and T in °C. This model explained 92\% of the variability in SMRind. Mass-specific MO2 adjusted for a 5 g shrimp (SMR5g) was not influenced by developmental stage indicating that the regression model for SMRind was valid regardless of variations in size at maturity and sex transition. Routine and active metabolic rates followed the same variation pattern in relation to temperature and developmental stage than SMR. Finally, thermal coefficients (Q10) were in the normal range found for crustaceans, Q10 values varying from 1.73 to 4.97.},

Effects of acute temperature changes on these patterns were measured. Species were the shiner surfperch,Cymatogaster aggregata and the señorita wrasse,Oxyjulis californica.Metabolic data were analyzed three different ways. The first (method of Brett) was based upon mass specific oxygen uptake and length specific swim speed; data in this form were analyzed both as best-fit power functions and as the mathematically equivalent least squares linear regressions for semi-log plots. The second and third methods were based upon drag based hydromechanical theory concerning power requirements for swimming in fishes: total metabolic ratesvs. absolute swimming speeds, analyzed both as best-fit power functions and least squares linear regressions for log-log plots.The main finding, demonstrated by all three methods of calculation, was that the slopes of all regression lines (both semi-log and log-log) and the exponents of almost all power functions (five out of six) were very low. The Brett method applied to subcarangiform swimmers usually produces slopes averaging 0.36 (using base-10 logarithms). The slopes calculated by that method in the present study were 0.02–0.08. Low slope values could result from the interactions of many factors. Additional data are needed to determine which combinations of factors actually produced them. On this basis metabolic rate data on intact labriform swimmers, by themselves, appear unusable as empirical tests of theory based predictions concerning power requirements for fish swimming.},

The book also provides an introduction to the subject for those with general interests in statistics. The important role of density estimation as a graphical technique is reflected by the inclusion of more than 50 graphs and figures throughout the text.Several contexts in which density estimation can be used are discussed, including the exploration and presentation of data, nonparametric discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, simulation and the bootstrap, bump hunting, projection pursuit, and the estimation of hazard rates and other quantities that depend on the density. This book includes general survey of methods available for density estimation. The Kernel method, both for univariate and multivariate data, is discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on ways of deciding how much to smooth and on computation aspects. Attention is also given to adaptive methods, which smooth to a greater degree in the tails of the distribution, and to methods based on the idea of penalized likelihood.},

By interspersing short periods of closed-chamber oxygen consumption measurements with regular flush periods, accurate oxygen uptake rate measurements can be made without the accumulation of waste products, particularly carbon dioxide, which may confound results. Automating the procedure with easily available hardware and software further reduces error by allowing many measurements to be made over long periods thereby minimizing animal stress due to acclimation issues. This paper describes some of the fundamental principles that need to be considered when designing and carrying out automated intermittent-flow respirometry (e.g. chamber size, flush rate, flush time, chamber mixing, measurement periods and temperature control). Finally, recent advances in oxygen probe technology and open source automation software will be discussed in the context of assembling relatively low cost and reliable measurement systems.},

Recent research suggests that environmental parameters, such as food supply, settling substrate availability or aragonite saturation state may represent important precursors controlling habitat suitability for CWC. However, the effect of one principal environmental factor, temperature, on CWC key physiological processes is still unknown. In order to evaluate this effect on calcification, respiration, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) net flux, colonies of Mediterranean L. pertusa and M. oculata were acclimated in aquaria to three temperatures (12, 9 and 6°C), by consecutive decrements of 1 month duration. L. pertusa and M. oculata maintained at Mediterranean control conditions (i.e. 12°C) displayed constant rates, on average respiring 4.8 and 4.0µmolO2cm−2coral surface aread−1, calcifying 22.3 and 12.3µmolCaCO3g−1skeletal dry weightd−1 and net releasing 2.6 and 3.1µmolDOCcm−2coral surface aread−1, respectively. Respiration of L. pertusa was not affected by lowered temperatures, while M. oculata respiration declined significantly (by 48\%) when temperature decreased to 9°C and 6°C relative to controls. L. pertusa calcification at 9°C was similar to controls, but decreased significantly (by 58\%) at 6°C. For M. oculata, calcification declined by 41\% at 9°C and by 69\% at 6°C. DOC net flux was similar throughout the experiment for both CWC. These findings reveal species-specific physiological responses by CWC within their natural temperature range. L. pertusa shows thermal acclimation in respiration and calcification, while these mechanisms appear largely absent in M. oculata. Conclusively, species-specific thermal acclimation may significantly affect the occurrence and local abundance of cosmopolitan CWC species, consequently influencing their important role in habitat engineering and ecosystem functioning in various thermal environments.},

	abstract = {Mass cultivation of marine copepods as live feed requires predictable and uniform production of a standard product for the end users, the hatcheries. A previously undescribed large egg type, measuring a mean diameter of 106.5μm, was characterized and compared to normal eggs (82.3μm) from a continuous culture of Acartia tonsa. The large egg type was significantly larger than the normal eggs, and only 1 large out of approximately 100 000 normal-sized eggs was found. Mean egg densities was 1.34±0.16g/cm3 and 1.20±0.07g/cm3 for normal and large eggs, respectively. The hypothesis that large eggs were dormant, as indicated from the relatively low hatching success of 60\%, within 48h, was rejected as no significant difference was found in egg volume-specific respiration rates or histological analysis of the chorion between the two egg types. The nauplii hatched from large eggs were correspondingly large, and the copepods remained large when developing into adulthood. The fact that copepods hatched from large eggs were fertile indicates no chromosomal abnormalities and suggests that this egg type represents the upper tail end of eggs in a classical normal distribution of size vs. frequency. The next generations' eggs were not as large as the ones they originated from suggesting that the rare large eggs represent a maternal effect. The large size eggs do however pose an interesting selection potential for designing large species-specific live feed products in aquaculture.},
