Can we keep *everything* regarding changes in here, rather than moving some to NEWS.md. It's hard to keep track what's where. We can decide what to include in NEWS just before we release.

For now - direct changes/commits to dev go in here. Keep a separate changelog text file in each branch, then we can copy it in here when it is merged.

NEWS
# [version 1.1.1] -- 2019-07-24
Quick fixes and changes.

- **FIXED**: Issue #58: `auto_rate()` stops with obscure message when input datasets are small.
- **FIXED**: Issue #66: `auto_rate()` included references to the method argument called `"default"`, however that was deprecated some time ago. Code has been cleaned up to remove them.
- **FIXED**: Issue #61: `pcrit()` and `calc_pcrit()` had issues importing the function `broken_stick()` into the cluster, resulting in the functions failing if the package wasn't loaded but called, i.e. using `respR::pcrit()`
- **FIXED**: The `summary()` generic for the function `adjust_rate()` was never exported properly.




(we don't have to include all these, but we should keep a full list however minor)

Fixes
- FIX: summary() works correctly on `adjust_rate` objects (missing #' @export)
- FIX: plot() works correctly on `auto_rate` objects (missing #' @export)
- FIX: subset_data() - fix for failure with inspect() objects
- FIX: format_time() - fix for not appending new numeric time column onto a data.table
- FIX: format_time() - fix for data.frames columns being renamed on return (by using data.frame instead of cbind)
- FIX: auto_rate() - Fix for plots failing where result contains an NA (fix in multi.p() involving clip)



Changes
- CHANGE: format_time - numeric time column name changed from `elapsed` to `time.num` (elapsed is not a good term for non-english speakers)
- CHANGE: Documentation - terminology clarifed. Rates now referred to as absolute (for whole animal or chamber) or mass specific.
  - (ugh, might have to revist the above - we use absolute in subset_rate for absolute value between +/-... )
- CHANGE: Updated startup message for full MEE citation
- CHANGE: import_file docs - updated supported systems list
- CHANGE: Updated README
- CHANGE: Better original par() restoration behaviour (TIL: put them next to each other at start and use on.exit() to restore and it stills works if there is some sort of plotting error that causes it to exit early)
- CHANGE: inspect_data and pcrit now have 'function deprecated' warnings in docs and code
- CHANGE: adjust_rate - changed rates from 'corrected' to 'adjusted.rate' in output (updated code in convert_rate, convert_DO to match)
- CHANGE: convert_rate - outputs renamed (e.g. output to output.rate, absolute to absolute.rate etc.). should not affect code anywhere else since this is last function



========================== inspect() ============================
Changes

- `time = 1` and `oxygen = 2` the defaults rather than NULL
- if `oxygen = NULL` now inspects ALL columns
- added `width` input for rolling reg plot (default 0.1)
- updated roxygen docs. There was quite a lot out of date...
- Added message if multiple columns inspected that subsequent functions will only use first 2 by default
- Muliple rate inspection plot improved. Now all plot on same axes ranges, better colours and spacing.
- FIX: Rolling rate plot failed with even a single NA in time or oxygen data.

print.inspect
- minor edits to console print out (e.g. messages print relevant columns names rather than both x/y col names, better spacing)
- if uneven time, now prints min/max intervals found
- time error locations now printed out when multiple o2 columns inspected



========================== S3 Methods ============================
print.adjust_rate
- stops if 'pos' too high
- FIX: prints adjustment correctly if pos > 1

summary.adjust_rate
- FIX: 'adjustment' column was missing

print.convert_rate
- stops if 'pos' too high
- FIX: prints summary table as columns correctly
