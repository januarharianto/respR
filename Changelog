Can we keep *everything* in here, rather than moving some to NEWS.md? Hard to keep track what's waiting in dev, what's not.....
Then we can decide what to include
Let's make that below and copy over when we are ready to release

# [version 1.1.1] -- 2019-07-24
Quick fixes and changes.

- **FIXED**: Issue #58: `auto_rate()` stops with obscure message when input datasets are small.
- **FIXED**: Issue #66: `auto_rate()` included references to the method argument called `"default"`, however that was deprecated some time ago. Code has been cleaned up to remove them.
- **FIXED**: Issue #61: `pcrit()` and `calc_pcrit()` had issues importing the function `broken_stick()` into the cluster, resulting in the functions failing if the package wasn't loaded but called, i.e. using `respR::pcrit()`
- **FIXED**: The `summary()` generic for the function `adjust_rate()` was never exported properly.
