Changelog - new_background branch

- NEW: Added `background_lin.rd` and `background_exp.rd` data for testing new background correction functionality
- CHANGE: ALL FUNCTIONS: changed dataframe in output to `$dataframe` for consistency and simpler code (was df, data, dataframe, etc....)

subsample()
- NEW: Now works on vectors as well as data frames
- NEW: Added 'length.out' argument which uniformly subsamples to exact number of rows (data frame) or length (vectors)
- FIX: works and plots correctly (first data column only) with multicolumn data frames
