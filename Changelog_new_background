Changelog - new_background branch

- NEW: Added `background_lin.rd` and `background_exp.rd` data for testing new background correction functionality
- CHANGE: ALL FUNCTIONS: changed dataframe in output to `$dataframe` for consistency (was $df, $data, $dataframe, etc. Makes for MUCH simpler code)

subsample()
- NEW: Now works on vectors as well as data frames
- NEW: Added 'length.out' argument which uniformly subsamples to exact number of rows (data frame) or length (vectors)
- FIX: works and plots correctly (first data column only) with multicolumn data frames

calc_rate.bg
- removed "input detected" message at start - other functions don't have this

adjust_rate
- completely rewritten to allow several new methods, including dynamic background correction
- (same 3 original inputs (x, by, method) plus four new ones. Defaults to "mean" so old code should output same results as it did before).
