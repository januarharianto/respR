Description: respR provides a structural, reproducible workflow for the 
    processing and analysis of respirometry data. It contains analytical 
    functions and utilities for working with oxygen timeseries to determine 
    respiration or oxygen production rates, and to make it easier to report and 
    share analyses. See the respR GitHub webpage for documentation and examples.
