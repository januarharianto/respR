#' Adjust rates to account for background respiration or oxygen flux.
#'
#' The `adjust_rate` function adjusts oxygen uptake or production rates (for
#' example, as determined in [`calc_rate()`] or [`auto_rate()`]) for background
#' oxygen use by microbial organisms, or for other removal or input of oxygen
#' during a respirometry experiment. The function accepts numeric values, as
#' well as regular `respR` objects, and data frames. See [`calc_rate.bg()`] for
#' determining background rates, which is the recommended way of passing
#' background rates to `adjust_rate`. Rates determined in `calc_rate` are also
#' accepted as background rates.
#'
#' `adjust_rate` allows the rate, or multiple rates, in `x` to be adjusted in a
#' number of ways, as detailed below. Note that for those methods which accept
#' them, `by` and `by2` inputs of class `calc_rate`, `calc_rate.bg`,
#' `data.frame` or `inspect` can contain multiple columns of background oxygen
#' data, as long as they share the same numeric time data in column 1. In this
#' case, the mean of all rates calculated for all oxygen columns is used to
#' perform adjustments (see [`inspect()`] and [`calc_rate.bg()`] to coerce data
#' to this form). The exception to this is the `"paired"` method, where each
#' rate in `by` (i.e. rate in each oxygen column) is paired with the rate at the
#' same position in `x` and used to adjust it.
#'
#' ***Note:*** take special care with the *sign* of the rate used for
#' adjustments. In `respR` oxygen uptake rates are negative, as they represent a
#' negative slope of oxygen against time. Background rates will normally also be
#' a negative value, while any input of oxygen would be positive. See Examples.
#'
#' ***Methods***
#'
#' There are six methods of adjustment, briefly summarised here, with more
#' detail below:
#'
#' `"value"` - All experimental rates in `x` are adjusted by a single background
#' rate value in `by`.
#'
#' `"mean"` - This is the default method. All experimental rates in `x` are
#' adjusted by the mean of all background rate values in `by`.
#'
#' `"paired"` - Experimental rates in `x` are adjusted by the background rate
#' value at the same position in `by`. Therefore requires `x` and `by` to have
#' the same number of rates.
#'
#' `"concurrent"` - Experimental rates in `x` are adjusted by a background rate
#' calculated over the same time window in the data in `by`. Therefore requires
#' `x` and `by` to share the same time data and length (broadly speaking).
#'
#' `"linear"` - The time values for experimental rates in `x` are used to
#' calculate an adjustment value based on a background rate that changes
#' *linearly* with respect to time over the course of an experiment. Requires
#' two background recordings or values (`by`, `by2`), and that all data share
#' the same time data or scale.
#'
#' `"exponential"` - The time values for experimental rates in `x` are used to
#' calculate an adjustment value based on a background rate that changes
#' *exponentially* with respect to time over the course of an experiment.
#' Requires two background recordings or values (`by`, `by2`), and that all data
#' share the same time data or scale.
#'
#' ***More Detail***
#'
#' `"value"` - For experiments in which the rate from a single background
#' experiment (or any single background value) is being used to adjust one or
#' more specimen rates. Each rate in `x` is adjusted by the subtracting the
#' single value in `by`. `x` can be a numeric value, numeric vector,
#' `calc_rate`, `calc_rate.int`, `auto_rate`, or `auto_rate.int` object. `by`
#' can be a single numeric value, a `calc_rate.bg` object containing a single
#' `$rate.bg` (i.e. calculated from a 2-column data frame of time~oxygen), or a
#' `calc_rate` object containing a single `$rate`. All other inputs should be
#' `NULL`.
#'
#' `"mean"` - For experiments in which the mean rate from multiple background
#' experiments is being used to adjust one or more specimen rates. Each rate in
#' `x` is adjusted by subtracting the *mean* of all background rates in `by`.
#' `x` can be a numeric value, numeric vector, `calc_rate`, `calc_rate.int`,
#' `auto_rate`, or `auto_rate.int` object. `by` can be a numeric value, numeric
#' vector, `calc_rate.bg` object containing multiple `$rate.bg`, or a
#' `calc_rate` object containing multiple `$rate`. All other inputs should be
#' `NULL`. If `by` is a single value, this will obviously have the same output
#' as the `"value"` method.
#'
#' `"paired"` - For experiments where multiple specimen experiments are being
#' adjusted by multiple different background rates. This is a vectorised
#' adjustment operation: rates in `x` are adjusted by the background rates at
#' the same position in `by`. That is, the first `x` adjusted by the first `by`,
#' second `x` by second `by`, etc. `x` can be a numeric value, numeric vector,
#' `calc_rate`, `calc_rate.int`, `auto_rate`, or `auto_rate.int` object. `by`
#' can be a numeric vector *of the same length*, a `calc_rate.bg` or `calc_rate`
#' object where the `$rate.bg` or `$rate` element is the *same length* as the
#' rates in `x` to be adjusted. All other inputs should be `NULL`.
#'
#' `"concurrent"` - For experiments in which one or more concurrent "blanks" or
#' background experiments are run alongside specimen experiments. Rates in `x`
#' are adjusted by a background rate calculated over the same time window in the
#' data in `by`. That is, the start and end time of each `x` rate is used to fit
#' a linear regression and calculate a background rate in the `$dataframe` in
#' `by`. `x` must be an `calc_rate`, `calc_rate.int`, `auto_rate`, or
#' `auto_rate.int` object. `by` must be a `data.frame`, `inspect`,
#' `calc_rate.bg`, or `calc_rate` object containing time~oxygen data. If there
#' are multiple columns of background oxygen the mean rate across the same time
#' window in all columns is used. In `calc_rate.bg` and `calc_rate` objects the
#' `$rate.bg` or `$rate` element is not used, only the `$dataframe`. The `x` and
#' `by` data must share (broadly) the *same time data or scale in the same
#' units*. If the `x` and `by` data differ in length by more than 5% or some
#' time values are not shared between the two datasets, a warning is given, but
#' the adjustment is nevertheless performed using the available data, by using
#' the closest matching time window in the background data.
#'
#' `"linear"` - This is a dynamic adjustment, intended for experiments in which
#' the background oxygen rate *changes* over the course of the experiment
#' *linearly* with respect to time. This is typical of long duration
#' respirometry experiments in high temperatures, where a "blank" is conducted
#' at the start of the experiment before the specimen is put in, and again at
#' the end after it is taken out. It requires therefore two background
#' recordings sharing the same numeric *time data* or *time scale*, in the same
#' units as the experiment to be adjusted. These can also be entered as two rate
#' *values* with associated *timestamps*, which again must share the same time
#' scale and units as the rate to be adjusted. This method can also be used in
#' experiments in which a concurrent blank experiment is conducted alongside
#' specimen experiments (as described in the `concurrent` method above), but in
#' which the background data is deemed too noisy to fit reliable regressions
#' over the short timescales specimen rates are determined. In this case, *any*
#' two reliable segments of the background data of any duration can be used to
#' determine how the background rate changes over the course of the experiment,
#' and then this used to adjust specimen rates using the appropriate rate
#' timestamps. The *time~background rate* linear relationship is calculated
#' using the midpoint of the time range of the `by` and `by2` rate regressions
#' (or values plus timestamps). The adjustments to `x` rates are calculated by
#' taking the midpoint of the time range over which it was determined and
#' applying it to the `by~by2` linear relationship. The `x` input can be a
#' numeric value, numeric vector, or a `calc_rate`, `calc_rate.int`,
#' `auto_rate`, or `auto_rate.int` object containing single or multiple rates.
#' The `by` input is the first background recording or rate value, and `by2` the
#' second background recording or rate value.
#'
#' While it is typical, the `x` rates do not necessarily need to be at
#' intermediate timepoints to the `by/by2` times. these are used only to
#' establish a *time~background rate* linear relationship, which can be
#' extrapolated before or after the time values used to calculate it. The `by`
#' and `by2` inputs can be a `data.frame`, `inspect` or `calc_rate.bg` object
#' containing background time~oxygen data. Alternatively, the rate `x`, and
#' background rates `by` and `by2` can be entered as values, in which case the
#' associated timepoints at which these were determined (generally the midpoint
#' of the time range over which the linear regression was fit) must be entered
#' as `time_x`, `time_by`, and `time_by2` (these timepoints are otherwise
#' automatically extracted from the input objects). Multiple `x` rates with
#' multiple `time_x` timepoints can be entered and adjusted, but only one linear
#' background rate relationship applied, that is `by`, `by2`, `time_by`, and
#' `time_by2` must be single numeric values in the correct units.
#'
#' `"exponential"` - This is a dynamic adjustment, intended for experiments in
#' which the background oxygen rate *changes* over the course of the experiment
#' *exponentially* with respect to time. This is typical of long duration
#' respirometry experiments in high temperatures, where a "blank" is conducted
#' at the start of the experiment before the specimen is put in, and again at
#' the end after it is taken out, and the background rate is found to increase
#' exponentially. This is identical to the `"linear"` method (see above for
#' requirements), except the adjustment is calculated as an exponential
#' relationship of the form - `lm(log(c(by, by2)) ~ c(time_by, time_by2))`.
#'
#' ## S3 Generic Functions
#'
#' Saved output objects can be used in the generic S3 functions `print()`,
#' `summary()`, and `mean()`.
#'
#' - `print()`: prints a single result, by default the first adjusted rate.
#' Others can be printed by passing the `pos` input. e.g. `print(x, pos = 2)`
#'
#' - `summary()`: prints summary table of all results and metadata, or those
#' specified by the `pos` input. e.g. `summary(x, pos = 1:5)`. The summary can
#' be exported as a separate dataframe by passing `export = TRUE`.
#'
#' - `mean()`: calculates the mean of all adjusted rates, or those specified by
#' the `pos` input. e.g. `mean(x, pos = 1:5)` The mean can be exported as a
#' separate value by passing `export = TRUE`.
