#' Randomly generate data for internal testing of `auto_rate()`'s linear method.
#'
#' Generate data of size `len` that is coerced to mimic common respirometry
#' data. This is an internal function not meant for public use. We will modify
#' this function at any time, which may irreversibly change the outputs. Do NOT
#' use this for work! This function was first created to test `auto_rate()`
#' using the other internal function, `test_lin()`, but we decided to publish
#' the code as it is an effective (and visually-appealing) tool for teaching
#' purposes. This function is by no means comprehensive and we encourage users
#' to generate data that suit their own unique situations.
#'
#' `sim_data()` creates 3 types of data that we think are common in respirometry
#' or oxygen flux data. The data types can be selected using the `method`
#' argument:
#'
#' - `"default"`: data is made up of a linear segment of known length and slope,
#' with a non-linear segment, generated by a sine or cosine function depending
#' on whether the slope is positive or negative, appended to the beginning of
#' the data. The shape of the dataset is designed to mimic many similar data
#' whereby the initial sections of the data are often non-linear. Here the slope
#' is randomly generated using `rnorm(1, 0, 0.025)`, the length of the inital
#' segment randomly generated using `floor(abs(rnorm(1, .25*len, .05*len)))`
#' where `len` is the total number of observations in the data, and the
#' amplitude of the segment also randomly generated using `rnorm(1, .8, .05)`.
#'
#' - `"corrupted"`: same as `"default"`, but "corrupted" data is inserted
#' randomly at any point in the linear segment. The data corruption is chosen as
#' a sudden dip in the reading, which recovers. This event mimics equipment
#' interference that sometimes happens, but does not necessarily invalidate the
#' dataset if the corrupted section is omitted from analysis, The dip is
#' generated by a cosine function of fixed amplitude of 1, and the length is
#' randomly generated.
#'
#' - `"segmented"`: same as `"default"`, but the data is modified to contain two
#' linear segments. The slope of the second linear segment is randomly picked at
#' between 0.5 and 0.6 of the first linear segment. Its length is also randomly
#' generated but always smaller than the first segment.
#'
#' Normally-distributed noise is added to the dataset to add variation, which
#' can be modified using the `"sd"` argument.
#'
#'
#' @param len numeric. Defaults at 300. Number of observations in the dataset.
#' @param type character. What kind of data should the function generate?
#'   Available for use: "default", "corrupted" and "segmented".
#' @param sd numeric. Defaults at 0.05. This is the amount of noise to add to
#'   the system, randomly generated as a standard deviation based on the entire
#'   data set.
#' @param preview logical. Defaults to TRUE. Plots the generated data as an xy.
#'
#' @return A list containing the dataframe, the slope and the length of the
#'   linear section of the data, to be used for analysis in the function
#'   `test_lin()`.
