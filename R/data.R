#' Respirometry data of the sea urchin, *Heliocidaris Erythrogramma*
#'
#' Multiple measurements of oxygen consumption in a single sea urchin,
#' *Heliocidaris erythrogramma*, obtained using intermittent flow respirometry.
#' The experiment was conducted at the Sydney Institute of Marine Science in
#' Sydney, Australia. There are a total of 3 replicates showing declining oxygen,
#' separated by flushes where new water was added showing increasing oxygen.
#' Data was collected using a Vernier Optical DO probe (ODO-BTA).

#' concentrations (cols 10:13, which is simply the numeric difference between

#' individual inflow oxygen recordings. Outflow (2:5) and inflow (6:9) columns
