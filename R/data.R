#' Respirometry data of the sea urchin, *Heliocidaris Erythrogramma*
#'
#' Multiple measurements of oxygen consumption in a single sea urchin,
#' *Heliocidaris erythrogramma*, obtained using intermittent flow respirometry.
#' The experiment was conducted at the Sydney Institute of Marine Science in
#' Sydney, Australia. There are a total of 3 replicates where the respirometry
#' chamber was flushed. Data was collected using a Vernier Optical DO probe
#' (ODO-BTA).

#' concentrations (oxy.delta.1, etc., which is simply the numeric difference

#' oxygen concentrations as recorded from a shared header tank (oxy.header)
#' supplying all chambers, to use as an alternative to the individual inflow
#' oxygen recordings. In addition, there are two columns of recordings from an
#' empty control respirometer, or "blank" experiment (oxy.out.blank,
#' oxy.in.blank) to determine background respiration.
#'
#' The third dataset (col 4) has a period of higher rates at around the 2000s
