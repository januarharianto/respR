\title{Multi-column respirometry data of the sea urchin, \emph{Heliocidaris
Erythrogramma}, including background respiration}
\format{
A data frame object consisting of one column of time, 16 columns of
urchin oxygen consumption (\code{a} to \code{p}) and 2 columns of background oxygen
consumption (\code{b1} & \code{b2}). There are 271 rows of data spanning 45 minutes.

\description{
Oxygen consumption data of 16 individual \emph{Heliocidaris erythrogramma}
specimens. In addition, there are two columns of background respiration.
These were trial runs to determine the precision of Vernier Optical DO probes
(ODO-BTA), and thus chamber volumes, specimen masses and other parameters
were not recorded.
