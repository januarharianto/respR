\title{Multi-column respirometry data of the sea urchin, \emph{Heliocidaris
Erythrogramma}, including background respiration}
\format{A data frame object consisting of one column of time, 16 columns of
urchin oxygen consumption (a-p) and 2 columns of background oxygen
consumption (b1 & b2). There are 271 rows of data spanning 45 minutes.}

\description{
Oxygen consumption data of 16 individual \emph{Heliocidaris erythrogramma}
specimens. In addition, there are 2 measurements of background respiration.
These were trial runs to determine the precision of the new Vernier Optical
DO probes (ODO-BTA), and thus chamber volumes and specimen masses were not
recorded.
