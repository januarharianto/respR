\title{Parse date-time data to numeric time for use in respR functions}
\usage{
format_time(x, time = 1, format = "ymdHMS", start = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector or data frame containing strings or class POSIX.ct date-time
data to be converted to numeric.}

\item{time}{numeric value or vector. Specifies column(s) containing date-time
data. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{format}{string. Code describing structure of date-time data. See
Details.}

\item{start}{numeric. At what time (in seconds) should the formatted time
data start? Default is \code{1}.}
}
\value{
\strong{Output}: If the input is a vector, output is a vector of equal
length containing the numeric time data. For data frame inputs, an
identical data frame is returned, with a new column named \code{time_num} added
as the \strong{final} column.
}
\description{
A function to parse class POSIX.ct or text strings of date-time data to
numeric time for use in \code{respR} functions.
}
\details{
Regardless of input, all data are parsed to numeric time data in seconds
duration from the first entry starting at 1. If you want the times to start
at a different time, a \code{start} value can be specified, in which case the
series starts at that number (in seconds) and all subsequent times are
shifted forward by the same amount.
\subsection{Input}{

Input can be a vector, or data frame. If a data frame, the column(s) of the
date-time data are specified using the \code{time} input. By default the first
column is assumed to contain the date-time data (i.e. \code{time = 1}).

If the date-time data is split over several columns (e.g. date in one column,
time in another), multiple columns can be specified (e.g. \code{time = c(1,2)}).
In this case, the \code{format} setting should reflect the correct order as
entered in \code{time}.
}

\subsection{Time only data}{

Time-only data, that is times which lack an associated date, can also be
parsed. Normally, parsing time-only data will cause problems when the times
cross midnight (i.e. \code{00:00:00}). However, the function attempts to identify
when this occurs and parse the data correctly.
}

\subsection{Formatting}{

See the \code{\link{lubridate}} package for more detail on acceptable
formatting.

Date-time data can be unspaced or separated by any combination of spaces,
forward slashes, hyphens, dots, commas, colons, semicolons, or underscores.
E.g. all these are parsed as the same date-time: \verb{"2010-02-28 13:10:23", "20100228131023", "2010,02/28 13.10;23", "2010 02 28 13_10-23"}.
\itemize{
\item Times can be in 24H or 12H with AM/PM \cr E.g. "2010-02-28 13:10:23" or
"2010-02-28 1:10:23 PM"
\item Times without initial zero are parsed as 24H time \cr E.g. "1:10:23" is
same as "1:10:23 AM" or "01:10:23"
\item AM/PM take precedence over 24H formatting for 01-12h \cr E.g. "1:10:23 PM"
and "01:10:23 PM" are both same as "13:10:23"
\item However, 24H formatting for 13-24h takes precedence over AM/PM \cr E.g.
"13:10:23 AM" is identified as "1:10:23 PM" or "13:10:23"
}
}

\subsection{Syntax of 'format' input}{

Specify the order of year, month, day, and time in your date-time input.

\code{d} - Day of the month as decimal number (01--31 or 1--31).

\code{m} - Month of the year as decimal number (01--12 or 1--12).

\code{y} - Year (2010, 2001, 1989).

\code{H} - Hour as decimal number (00--24 or 0--24 or 00-12 (see \code{p})).

\code{M} - Minute as decimal number (00--59 or 0--59).

\code{S} - Second as decimal number (00--59 or 0--59).

\code{p} - AM/PM indicator for 12-h date-time format (e.g. "01/12/2020 1:30:44 PM
" would be \code{"dmyHMSp"}).

Specify the order using the \code{format} input, using separators or not
(optional): \code{"dmyHMS"}; \code{"dmy_HMS"} and \code{"d m y H M S"} are all the same. See
Examples.

Single experimental datasets should never span different time zones, so if a
time zone is present it is ignored for the purposes of calculating numeric
times.
