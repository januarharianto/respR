\title{Parse date-time data to numeric}
\usage{
format_time(x, time = 1, format = "ymdHMS", start = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector or data frame containing strings or class POSIX.ct date-time
data to be converted to numeric.}

\item{time}{numeric value or vector. Specifies column(s) containing date-time
data}

\item{format}{string. Code describing structure of date-time data. See
details. Directly relates to functionality in the package \code{lubridate}}

\item{start}{numeric. Default = 1. At what time (in seconds) should the
formatted time data start?}
}
\value{
A vector or data frame, depending on input. If input is a vector, a
vector of same length containing numeric time is returned. If input is a
data frame, the output data frame is identical, except a new column,
\code{time_num},of numeric time data in seconds is added as the last column.
}
\description{
A function to parse class POSIX.ct or text strings of date-time data to
numeric time for use in \code{respR} functions.
}
\details{
\strong{Input}

Input can be a vector, or data frame. If a vector, output is a vector of
equal length containing numeric time data. If a data frame, the column index
of the date-time data is specified using the \verb{time =} input. By default the
first column is assumed to contain the date-time data (i.e. \code{time = 1}).

Multiple columns can be specified (e.g. \code{time = c(1, 2)}) if the date-time
data is split over multiple columns (e.g. date in one column, time in
another). The function will combine these date and time strings together for
conversion. If multiple columns are specified, the \code{format} setting should
reflect the same order entered in \code{time}.

For data frame inputs, a data frame is returned which is identical to the
input except a new column called \code{time_num} is added as the last column.

Time-only data, that is times which lack an associated date, can also be
parsed. Normally, parsing time-only data will cause problems when the times
cross midnight (i.e. 00:00:00). However, the function attempts to identify
these occurences and parse the data correctly. It also prints a message with
the locations of these data regions for the user to check they look ok.

Date-time data can be unspaced or separated by any combination of spaces,
forward slashes, hyphens, dots, commas, colons, semicolons, or underscores.

E.g. all these are parsed as the same date-time: \verb{"2010-02-28 13:10:23", "20100228131023", "2010,02/28 13.10;23", "2010 02 28 13_10-23"}.
\itemize{
\item Times can be in 24H or 12H with AM/PM \cr E.g. "2010-02-28 13:10:23" or
"2010-02-28 1:10:23 PM"
\item Times without initial zero are parsed as 24H time \cr E.g. "1:10:23" is
same as "1:10:23 AM" or "01:10:23"
\item AM/PM take precedence over 24H formatting for 01-12h \cr E.g. "1:10:23 PM"
and "01:10:23 PM" are both same as "13:10:23"
\item However, 24H formatting for 13-24h takes precedence over AM/PM \cr E.g.
"13:10:23 AM" is identified as "1:10:23 PM" or "13:10:23"
}

Regardless of input, all data are parsed to numeric time data in seconds
duration from the first entry starting at 1. However, if you want the times
to satrt at a different time, a \code{start} value can be specified, in which
case the series starts at that number (in seconds) and all subsequent times
are shifted forward by the same amount.

\strong{Syntax}

Simply identify the order which the year, month, day, and time appears in
your date-time input.

\describe{ \item{\code{d}}{Day of the month as decimal number (01--31 or 0--31).}
\item{\code{m}}{Month of the year as decimal number (01--12 or 1--12).}
\item{\code{y}}{Year (2010, 2001, 1989).} \item{\code{H}}{Hour, must be capitalised
(\code{H}, not \code{h}). Decimal number (00--24 or 0--24).} \item{\code{M}}{Minute, must be
capitalised (\code{M}, not \code{m}). Decimal number (00--59 or 0--59).}
\item{\code{S}}{Second, must be capitalised (\code{S}, not \code{s}). Decimal number (00--59
or 0--59).} \item{\code{p}}{AM/PM indicator. Adding this will format the data as
12-h date-time format.} }

Print the order in the \code{format} string argument, using separators if you
choose to (optional): \code{"dmyHMS"}; \code{"dmy_HMS"} and \code{"d m y H M S"} are all the
same. Single datasets should not span different time zones, so if a time zone
is present it is ignored for the purposes of calculating numeric times. If
multiple columns have been specified in the \code{time} argument, the \code{format}
should reflect the same order.
