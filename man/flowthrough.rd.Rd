\title{Flowthrough respirometry data on the chiton, \emph{Mopalia lignosa}}
\format{
A data frame object consisting of 935 rows (approx 16 mins of
data),and 4 columns: time, oxygen inflow and outflow concentrations, and
oxygen delta (the outflow minus inflow concentrations).
}
\usage{
flowthrough.rd
}
\description{
A single experiment on the chiton species \emph{Mopalia lignosa} in a custom-built
flowthrough respirometry system. Conducted at University of British Columbia,
Vancouver, BC, Canada.
