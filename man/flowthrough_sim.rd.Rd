\title{Flowthrough respirometry data with increasing background rate}
\format{
A data frame object consisting of 3740 rows (approx 62 mins of
data),and 4 columns: time (col 1), specimen oxygen outflow concentrations
(col 2), control/blank chamber oxygen outflow concentrations (col 3), and
inflow concentrations recorded from a shared header tank (col 4).

flowthrough_sim.rd

\description{
A simulated dataset for testing and demonstrating flowthrough respirometry
analyses and background adjustment when the background respiration is
increases over the course of the experiment. Contains one
column of numeric time data (num.time), one column of specimen outflow oxygen
concentrations (oxy.out.spec), one column of control or "blank" chamber
outflow oxygen concentrations (oxy.out.blank), and one column of inflow
oxygen concentrations as recorded from a shared header tank (oxy.header)
supplying both chambers.
