\description{
Multiple measurements of oxygen consumption in a single sea urchin,
\emph{Heliocidaris erythrogramma}, obtained using intermittent flow respirometry.
The experiment was conducted at the Sydney Institute of Marine Science in
Sydney, Australia. There are a total of 3 replicates where the respirometry
chamber was flushed. Data was collected using a Vernier Optical DO probe
(ODO-BTA).
