\title{Respirometry data of the squid, \emph{Doryteuthis opalescens}}
\format{
A data frame object consisting of 2 columns (\verb{$Time} and \verb{$Oxygen})
and 34120 rows (approx 9.5h of data).

squid.rd
}
\description{
A single experiment on the squid species \emph{Doryteuthis opalescens} in a Loligo
Systems swim tunnel and Witrox oxygen probe system. Oxygen was recorded to
very low concentrations, making this dataset suitable for determining PCrit.
Experiment conducted at Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University, Pacific
Grove, California. Mean temperature, salinity and atmospheric pressure are
supplied below to allow for conversion to oxygen concentration units.
