\format{A data frame object consisting of 2 columns (time and dissolved
oxygen) and 79,251 rows (approx 22h of data).}

\description{
Multiple measurements (106 replicates, plus initial and end background
measurements) of oxygen consumption in a zebrafish, \emph{Danio rerio}, obtained
using intermittent flow respirometry. Data kindly provided by Davide
Thambithurai (University of Glasgow). Note, the data has been injected with
random noise, and volume and mass below are not the actual values from the
experiment, but for example only.
