\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric value or vector, or object of class \code{\link[=calc_rate.ft]{calc_rate.ft()}} or
\code{\link[=adjust_rate.ft]{adjust_rate.ft()}}. Contains the rate(s) to be converted.}

\item{oxy.unit}{string. The dissolved oxygen units of the original raw data
used to determine the rate in \code{x}.}

\item{flowrate.unit}{string. The units of the flowrate through the
respirometer. See Details.}

\item{output.unit}{string. The output unit to convert the input rate to.
Should be in the correct order: "Oxygen/Time" or "Oxygen/Time/Mass" or
"Oxygen/Time/Area".}

\item{mass}{numeric. Mass/weight in \strong{kg}. This is the mass of the specimen
if you wish to calculate mass-specific rates.}

\item{area}{numeric. Surface area in \strong{m^2}. This is the surface area of the
specimen if you wish to calculate surface area-specific rates.}

\item{S}{numeric. Salinity (ppt). Defaults to NULL. Used in conversion of
some oxygen units. Fresh water should be entered as \code{S = 0}.}

\item{t}{numeric. Temperature(Â°C). Defaults to NULL. Used in conversion of
some oxygen units.}

\item{P}{numeric. Pressure (bar). Used in conversion of some oxygen units.
Defaults to a standard value of 1.013253 bar.}
}
\value{
Output is a \code{list} object containing the \verb{$rate.input}, and converted
rate(s) in \verb{$rate.output} in the \verb{$output.unit}, as well as inputs and
summary elements. Note, \verb{$rate.abs} is the \emph{absolute} rate in the output
unit minus the mass- or area-specific component. The \verb{$summary} table
element contains all rate parameters and data locations (depending on what
class of object was entered), adjustments (if applied), units, and more.
}
\description{
\code{convert_rate.ft} converts a unitless rate derived from \code{\link[=calc_rate.ft]{calc_rate.ft()}} or
\code{\link[=adjust_rate.ft]{adjust_rate.ft()}} into an absolute rate (i.e. whole specimen or whole
chamber), mass-specific rate (i.e. normalised by specimen mass), or
area-specific rate (i.e. normalised by specimen surface area) in any common
unit. These should be rates calculated as an oxygen delta (inflow minus
outflow oxygen) multiplied by the flowrate.
}
\details{
By default, \code{convert_rate.ft} converts the \verb{$rate} element from
\code{calc_rate.ft} objects, or the \verb{$rate.adjusted} element from \code{adjust_rate.ft}
objects if these are entered as the \code{x} input. Alternatively, a numeric value
or vector of rates can be input as \code{x}.
\subsection{Units}{

The \code{oxy.unit} of the original raw data used to calculated the rate is
required. Concentration units should use only SI units (\code{L} or \code{kg}) for the
denominator, e.g. \code{"mg/L"}, \code{"mmol/kg"}. Percentage saturation of air or
oxygen is accepted, as are oxygen pressure units. See \code{\link[=unit_args]{unit_args()}} for
details.

An \code{output.unit} is also required. If left \code{NULL}, The default of \code{"mgO2/h"}
is used, or \code{"mgO2/h/kg"} or \code{"mgO2/h/m2"} if a \code{mass} or \code{area} respectively
has been entered. The \code{output.unit} must be in the sequence \emph{Oxygen-Time}
(e.g. \code{"mg/h"}) for absolute rates, \emph{Oxygen-Time-Mass} (e.g. \code{"mg/h/kg"}) for
mass-specific rates, and \emph{Oxygen-Time-Area} (e.g. \code{"mg/h/cm2"}) for surface
area-specific rates.

Note, some oxygen input or output units require temperature (\code{t}) and
salinity (\code{S}) to perform conversions. For freshwater experiments, salinity
should be entered as zero (i.e. \code{S = 0}).

Strictly speaking the atmospheric pressure (\code{P}) should also be supplied. If
not, the default value of 1.013253 bar (standard pressure at sea level) is
used. In most locations which have a normal range (outside extreme weather
events) of around 20 millibars, any variability in pressure will have a
relatively minor effect on dissolved oxygen, and even less on calculated
rates. However, we would encourage users to enter the actual value if they
know it, or use historical weather data to find out what it was on the day.
See \code{\link[=unit_args]{unit_args()}} for details.

The \code{flowrate.unit} is required and should be the units of the \code{flowrate}
used in \code{calc_rate.ft} to calculate the rate, and should be in the form of
volume (L, ml, or ul) per unit time (s,m,h,d), for example in \code{"L/s"}. Note,
the volume component does \emph{NOT} represent the volume of the respirometer, and
the time component does \emph{NOT} represent the units or recording interval of
the original raw data.

The function uses an internal database and a fuzzy string matching algorithm
to accept various unit formatting styles. For example, \code{"mg/l"}, \code{"mg/L"},
\code{"mgL-1"}, \code{"mg l-1"}, \code{"mg.l-1"} are all parsed the same. See
\code{\link[=unit_args]{unit_args()}} for details of accepted units and their formatting. See also
\code{\link[=convert_val]{convert_val()}} for simple conversion between non-oxygen units.

\subsection{S3 Generic Functions}{

Saved output objects can be used in the generic S3 functions \code{print()},
\code{summary()}, and \code{mean()}.
\itemize{
\item \code{print()}: prints a single result, by default the first converted rate.
Others can be printed by passing the \code{pos} input. e.g. \code{print(x, pos = 2)}
\item \code{summary()}: prints a condensed version of the output \verb{$summary} table of
converted rates and metadata. Specific rows can be specified with the \code{pos}
input. e.g. \code{summary(x, pos = 1:5)}. This can be exported as a separate data
frame by passing \code{export = TRUE}. This will be the \emph{full} summary table, not
the one printed to the console, including all rate parameters, data
locations, adjustments if applied, units, and more. Note, the summary table
contains linear regression coefficients alongside other metadata. These
should not be confused with those in other functions such as \code{calc_rate}
where slopes represent rates and coefficients such as a high r-squared are
important. Here, slope represents the stability of the data region, in that
the closer the slope is to zero, the less the delta oxygen values in that
region vary, which is an indication of a region of stable rates. They are
included to enable possible future functionality where stable regions may be
automatically identified, and should generally be ignored. However, advanced
users can use regular R syntax to explore and subset the results using these
if they wish.
\item \code{mean()}: calculates the mean of all converted rates, or those specified by
the \code{pos} input. e.g. \code{mean(x, pos = 1:5)} The mean can be exported as a
separate value by passing \code{export = TRUE}.
