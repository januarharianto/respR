rates}
\usage{
convert_MR(
  x,
  from = NULL,
  to = NULL,
  S = NULL,
  t = NULL,
  P = NULL,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric value or vector, or object of class \code{convert_rate} or
\code{convert_rate.ft}. Contains the rate(s) to be converted.}

\item{from}{string. The unit of the input metabolic rate(s). Should be in the
correct order: Oxygen/Time, Oxygen/Time/Mass or Oxygen/Time/Area. If \code{x} is
a \code{convert_rate} or \code{convert_rate.ft} object this is extracted
automatically and any input specified via \code{from} is ignored.}

\item{to}{string. The unit to convert the metabolic rate(s) to. Should be in
the correct order: Oxygen/Time, Oxygen/Time/Mass or Oxygen/Time/Area. See
\code{unit_args()}.}

\item{S}{numeric. Salinity (ppt). Defaults to NULL. Used in conversion of
some oxygen units. Freshwater should be entered as \code{S = 0}. If \code{x} is a
\code{convert_rate} or \code{convert_rate.ft} object this is extracted automatically
if present and any other input ignored.}

\item{t}{numeric. Temperature(Â°C). Defaults to NULL. Used in conversion of
some oxygen units. If \code{x} is a \code{convert_rate} or \code{convert_rate.ft} object
this is extracted automatically if present and any other input ignored.}

\item{P}{numeric. Pressure (bar). Used in conversion of some oxygen units.
Defaults to a standard value of 1.013253 bar. If \code{x} is a \code{convert_rate} or
\code{convert_rate.ft} object this is extracted automatically if present and any
other input ignored.}

\item{quiet}{logical. Suppresses the summary of the converted rates printed
to the console. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
If the \code{x} input rates are a numeric value or vector, output is a
numeric value or vector of the same length. If \code{x} is a \code{convert_rate} or
\code{convert_rate.ft} object, output is a new \code{convert_rate} or
\code{convert_rate.ft} object with all rates in the \verb{$summary} table,
\verb{$rate.output} and \verb{$output.unit} elements converted to the new units. This
allows you to convert results of analyses to a different unit without
having to repeat the entire analysis.
}
\description{
Converts metabolic rates to a different unit. These can be absolute rates
(i.e. whole chamber or whole specimen e.g. \code{mg/h}), mass-specific rates (i.e.
normalised by specimen mass  e.g. \code{mg/h/kg}), or area-specific rates (i.e.
normalised by specimen surface area e.g. \code{mg/h/cm2}). Input rates can be a
numeric value or vector, in which case the converted rates are output as a
numeric of the same length in the new units. Alternatively, input can be an
object of class \code{convert_rate()} or \code{convert_rate.ft()}, in which case a new
\code{convert_rate} or \code{convert_rate.ft} object is returned with all rates in the
\verb{$summary} and other elements converted to the new units. This allows you to
convert results of analyses to a different unit without having to repeat the
entire analysis.

\details{
\subsection{Units}{

Units are specified using \code{from} and \code{to}. These should be in the sequence
\emph{Oxygen-Time} (e.g. \code{"mg/h"}) for absolute rates, \emph{Oxygen-Time-Mass} (e.g.
\code{"mg/h/kg"}) for mass-specific rates, and \emph{Oxygen-Time-Area} (e.g.
\code{"mg/h/cm2"}) for surface area-specific rates. If \code{x} is a \code{convert_rate} or
\code{convert_rate.ft} object the \code{from} unit is extracted automatically.

A fuzzy string matching algorithm is used to accept various unit formatting
styles. For example, \code{"mg/h"}, \code{"mg/H"}, \code{"mg hr-1"}, \code{"milligram per hour"}
are all parsed the same. See \code{unit_args()} for details of accepted units and
their formatting.

Note some units require salinity (\code{S}) and temperature (\code{t}) to perform the
conversion. For freshwater experiments, salinity should be entered as zero
(i.e. \code{S = 0}). These conversions also require the atmospheric pressure
(\code{P}). If not entered the default value of 1.013253 bar (standard pressure at
sea level) is used. If \code{x} is a \code{convert_rate} or \code{convert_rate.ft} object,
\code{S}, \code{t}, and \code{P} are extracted automatically if they are present (they may
not be if the original rate conversion did not require them). They are also
saved to the \verb{$inputs} element of the output object.
}

\subsection{More details}{

For \code{convert_rate} or \code{convert_rate.ft} inputs the primary \verb{$rate.output}
element is converted to the new unit and the \verb{$output.unit} also updated to
this new unit. These columns are also updated in the \verb{$summary} table, and in
addition the \code{rate.abs} column and, if relevant, the \code{rate.m.spec} or
\code{rate.a.spec} column. Note, the \verb{$call} element is updated to the
\code{convert_MR} call and the original call to \code{convert_rate} or
\code{convert_rate.ft} replaced. The \verb{$inputs} element will still contain the
original inputs, with the \code{output.unit} updated to the new \code{to} unit. In
addition \code{S}, \code{t}, and \code{P} are added if they weren't already present.
