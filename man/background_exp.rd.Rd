\title{Background respirometry data (exponential)}
\format{
A data frame object consisting of 20664 rows (approx 6 h of data),and
2 columns: \verb{$Time} in seconds, \verb{$Oxygen} in \% air saturation.
}
\usage{
background_exp.rd
}
\description{
Background oxygen consumption data. Data shows a background rate which
increases exponentially with respect to time. Taken from a Loligo swim tunnel
background recording. Oxygen recorded via a Witrox sensor in \% air saturation
over nearly 6 hours at 1 second intervals. Data is from a real experiment,
but oxygen decrease curve has been exaggerated to impose an exponential
increase in background consumption for testing purposes.
