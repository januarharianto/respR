\title{Background respirometry data (linear)}
\format{
A data frame object consisting of 20664 rows (approx 6 h of data),and
2 columns: \verb{$Time} in seconds, \verb{$Oxygen} in \% air saturation.
}
\usage{
background_lin.rd
}
\description{
Background oxygen consumption data. After initial 30 minutes, data shows a
background rate which increases linearly with respect to time. Taken from a
Loligo swim tunnel background recording. Oxygen recorded via a Witrox sensor
in \% air saturation over nearly 6 hours at 1 second intervals. Data is from a
real experiment, but has been manipulated to show a linear increase in
background rate for testing purposes.
