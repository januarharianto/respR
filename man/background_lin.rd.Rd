\title{Background respirometry data (linear)}
\format{
A data frame object consisting of 20664 rows (approx 6 h of data),and
2 columns: time in seconds, oxygen in \% air saturation.

\description{
Linear background oxygen consumption data. After initial 30 minutes, data
shows a generally linear background rate. Taken from a Loligo swim tunnel
background recording. Oxygen recorded via a Witrox sensor in \% air saturation
over nearly 6 hours at 1 second intervals. Data is from a real experiment,
but decrease in oxygen has been slightly exaggerated for testing purposes.
