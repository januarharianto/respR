\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric value or vector, or object of class \code{auto_rate},

\item{o2.unit}{string. The dissolved oxygen unit of the original data used to
determine the rate in \code{x}.}

\item{time.unit}{string. The time unit of the original data used to determine
the rate in \code{x}.}

\item{output.unit}{string. The output unit to convert the input rate to.
Should be in the correct order: "O2/Time" or "O2/Time/Mass" or
"O2/Time/Area".}

\item{volume}{numeric. Volume of water in \emph{\strong{litres}} in the respirometer or
respirometer loop.}

\item{mass}{numeric. Mass/weight in \emph{\strong{kg}}. This is the mass of the
specimen if you wish to calculate mass-specific rates.}

\item{area}{numeric. Surface area in \emph{\strong{m^2}}. This is the surface area of
the specimen if you wish to calculate surface area-specific rates.}

\item{S}{numeric. Salinity (ppt). Defaults to NULL. Used in conversion of
some oxygen units. Fresh water should be entered as \code{S = 0}.}

\item{t}{numeric. Temperature(Â°C). Defaults to NULL. Used in conversion of
some oxygen units.}

\item{P}{numeric. Pressure (bar). Used in conversion of some oxygen units.
Defaults to a standard value of 1.013253 bar.}

\description{
Converts a unitless rate derived from \code{\link[=calc_rate]{calc_rate()}}, \code{\link[=auto_rate]{auto_rate()}},
\code{\link[=adjust_rate]{adjust_rate()}}, or \code{\link[=calc_rate.bg]{calc_rate.bg()}} into an absolute (i.e. whole chamber
or whole speciemn) rate, or mass-specific rate (i.e. normalised by specimen
mass), or area-specific rate (i.e. normalised by specimen surface area) in
any common unit.
}
\details{
By default, \code{convert_rate} converts the primary \verb{$rate} element from
\code{calc_rate} and \code{auto_rate} objects, the \verb{$rate.adjusted} from \code{adjust_rate}
objects, and the \verb{$rate.bg} from \code{calc_rate.bg} objects. Additionally, any
numeric value or vector of rates can be input as \code{x}.
\subsection{Respirometer volume}{

Note, the \code{volume} input represents the \emph{effective volume} of the
respirometer, that is volume of fluid in the respirometry chamber, \strong{not}
the total respirometer volume or the specimen volume. Generally, this should
be the volume of the respirometer minus the volume of the specimen.
\href{https://github.com/nicholascarey/respfun#eff_vol}{See here} for help
with calculating effective volumes.
}

\subsection{Units}{

The \code{o2.unit} of the original data used to calculated the rate is required.
Concentration units should use only SI units (\code{L} or \code{kg}) for the
denominator, e.g. \code{"mg/L"}, \code{"mmol/kg"}. Percentage saturation of air or
oxygen is accepted, as are oxygen pressure units. See \code{\link[=unit_args]{unit_args()}} for
details.

The \code{time.unit} of the original data used to calculated the rate is also
required.

An \code{output.unit} is also required. If left NULL, The default of \code{"mgO2/h"} is
used, or \code{"mgO2/h/kg"} or \code{"mgO2/h/m2"} if a \code{mass} or \code{area} respectively
has been entered. The \code{output.unit} must be in the sequence \emph{O2-Time} (e.g.
\code{"mg/h"}) for absolute rates, \emph{O2-Time-Mass} (e.g. \code{"mg/h/kg"}) for
mass-specific rates, and \emph{O2-Time-Area} (e.g. \code{"mg/h/cm2"}) for surface
area-specific rates.

Note, some oxygen input or output units require temperature (\code{t}) and
salinity (\code{S}) to perform conversions. For freshwater experiments, salinity
should be entered as zero (i.e. \code{S = 0}).

Strictly speaking the atmospheric pressure (\code{P}) should also be supplied. If
not, the default value of 1.013253 bar (standard pressure at sea level) is
used. In most locations which have a normal range (outside extreme weather
events) of around 20 millibars, any variability in pressure will have a
relatively minor effect on dissolved oxygen, and even less on calculated
rates. However, we would encourage users to enter the true value if they know
it, or use historical weather data to find out what it was on the day. See
\code{\link[=unit_args]{unit_args()}} for details.

The function uses an internal database and a fuzzy string matching algorithm
to accept various unit formatting styles. For example, \verb{'mg/l', 'mg/L', 'mgL-1', 'mg l-1', 'mg.l-1'} are all parsed the same. See \code{\link[=unit_args]{unit_args()}} for
details of accepted units and their formatting. See also \code{\link[=convert_val]{convert_val()}}
for simple conversion between units.
}

\subsection{Output}{

Returns a \code{list} object containing the \verb{$rate.input}, and converted rate(s)
in \verb{$rate.output} in the \verb{$output.unit}, as well as inputs and summary
elements.
}

\subsection{S3 Generic Functions}{

Saved output objects can be used in the generic S3 functions \code{print()},
\code{summary()}, and \code{mean()}.
\itemize{
\item \code{print()}: prints a single result, by default the first converted rate.
Others can be printed by passing the \code{pos} input. e.g. \code{print(x, pos = 2)}
\item \code{summary()}: prints summary table of all converted rates and metadata, or
those specified by the \code{pos} input. e.g. \code{summary(x, pos = 1:5)}. The summary
can be exported as a separate dataframe by passing \code{export = TRUE}.
\item \code{mean()}: calculates the mean of all converted rates, or those specified by
the \code{pos} input. e.g. \code{mean(x, pos = 1:5)} The mean can be exported as a
separate value by passing \code{export = TRUE}.
