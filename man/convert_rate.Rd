\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric value or vector, or object of class \code{auto_rate},
\code{calc_rate}, \code{adjust_rate}, or \code{calc_rate.bg.} Contains the rate(s) to be
converted.}

\item{oxy.unit}{string. The dissolved oxygen unit of the original raw data
used to determine the rate in \code{x}.}

\item{time.unit}{string. The time unit of the original raw data used to
determine the rate in \code{x}.}

\item{output.unit}{string. The output unit to convert the input rate to.
Should be in the correct order: "Oxygen/Time" or "Oxygen/Time/Mass" or
"Oxygen/Time/Area".}

\item{volume}{numeric. Volume of water in \emph{\strong{litres}} in the respirometer or
respirometer loop.}

\item{mass}{numeric. Mass/weight in \emph{\strong{kg}}. This is the mass of the
specimen if you wish to calculate mass-specific rates.}

\item{area}{numeric. Surface area in \emph{\strong{m^2}}. This is the surface area of
the specimen if you wish to calculate surface area-specific rates.}

\item{S}{numeric. Salinity (ppt). Defaults to NULL. Used in conversion of
some oxygen units. Freshwater should be entered as \code{S = 0}.}

\item{t}{numeric. Temperature(Â°C). Defaults to NULL. Used in conversion of
some oxygen units.}

\item{P}{numeric. Pressure (bar). Used in conversion of some oxygen units.
Defaults to a standard value of 1.013253 bar.}

\value{
Output is a \code{list} object of class \code{convert_rate} containing the
\verb{$rate.input}, and converted rate(s) in \verb{$rate.output} in the
\verb{$output.unit}, as well as inputs and summary elements. Note, \verb{$rate.abs}
is the \emph{absolute} rate in the output unit minus the mass- or area-specific
component. The \verb{$summary} table element contains all rate regression
parameters and data locations (depending on what class of object was
entered), adjustments (if applied), units, and more.
}
\description{
Converts a unitless rate derived from \code{\link[=calc_rate]{calc_rate()}}, \code{\link[=auto_rate]{auto_rate()}},
\code{\link[=adjust_rate]{adjust_rate()}}, or \code{\link[=calc_rate.bg]{calc_rate.bg()}} into an absolute rate (i.e. whole
chamber or whole specimen), or mass-specific rate (i.e. normalised by
specimen mass), or area-specific rate (i.e. normalised by specimen surface
area) in any common unit.
}
\details{
By default, \code{convert_rate} converts the primary \verb{$rate} element from
\code{calc_rate} and \code{auto_rate} objects, the \verb{$rate.adjusted} from \code{adjust_rate}
objects, and the \verb{$rate.bg} from \code{calc_rate.bg} objects. Additionally, any
numeric value or vector of rates can be input as \code{x}.
\subsection{Respirometer volume}{

The \code{volume} of the respirometer is required and should be in litres (\code{L}).
Note, the \code{volume} represents the \emph{effective volume} of the respirometer,
that is \emph{volume of water} in the respirometry chamber. This is not
necessarily the same as the volume of the respirometer. Typically, it is the
volume of the respirometer \emph{minus} the volume of the specimen.
\href{https://github.com/nicholascarey/respfun#eff_vol}{See here} for help
with calculating effective volumes. It also does not refer to the specimen
volume.
}

\subsection{Units}{

The \code{oxy.unit} of the original raw data used to calculate the rate is
required. Concentration units should use only SI units (\code{L} or \code{kg}) for the
denominator, e.g. \code{"mg/L"}, \code{"mmol/kg"}. Percentage saturation of air
(\verb{\%Air}) or oxygen (\verb{\%Oxy}) is supported, as are oxygen pressure units. See
\code{\link[=unit_args]{unit_args()}} for details.

The \code{time.unit} of the original raw data used to calculate the rate is also
required (seconds, minutes, hours, or days).

An \code{output.unit} is also required and must be in the sequence \emph{Oxygen-Time}
(e.g. \code{"mg/h"}) for absolute rates, \emph{Oxygen-Time-Mass} (e.g. \code{"mg/h/kg"}) for
mass-specific rates, and \emph{Oxygen-Time-Area} (e.g. \code{"mg/h/cm2"}) for surface
area-specific rates. If left \code{NULL}, the default of \code{"mgO2/h"} is used, or
\code{"mgO2/h/kg"} or \code{"mgO2/h/m2"} if a \code{mass} or \code{area} respectively has been
entered.

Note, some oxygen input or output units require temperature (\code{t}) and
salinity (\code{S}) to perform conversions. For freshwater experiments, salinity
should be entered as zero (i.e. \code{S = 0}).

Strictly speaking, the atmospheric pressure (\code{P}) should also be entered. If
not, the default value of 1.013253 bar (standard pressure at sea level) is
used. In most locations which have a normal range (outside extreme weather
events) of around 20 millibars, any variability in pressure will have a
relatively minor effect on dissolved oxygen, and even less on calculated
rates. However, we would encourage users to enter the actual value if they
know it, or use historical weather data to find out what it was on the day.
See \code{\link[=unit_args]{unit_args()}} for details.

The function uses an internal database and a fuzzy string matching algorithm
to accept various unit formatting styles. For example, \code{"mg/l"}, \code{"mg/L"},
\code{"mgL-1"}, \code{"mg l-1"}, \code{"mg.l-1"} are all parsed the same. See
\code{\link[=unit_args]{unit_args()}} for details of accepted units and their formatting. See also
\code{\link[=convert_val]{convert_val()}} for simple conversion between non-oxygen units.
}

\subsection{S3 Generic Functions}{

Saved output objects can be used in the generic S3 functions \code{print()},
\code{summary()}, and \code{mean()}.
\itemize{
\item \code{print()}: prints a single result, by default the first converted rate.
Others can be printed by passing the \code{pos} input. e.g. \code{print(x, pos = 2)}
\item \code{summary()}: prints a condensed version of the output \verb{$summary} table of
converted rates and metadata. Specific rows can be specified with the \code{pos}
input. e.g. \code{summary(x, pos = 1:5)}. This can be exported as a separate data
frame by passing \code{export = TRUE}. This will be the \emph{full} summary table, not
the one printed to the console, including all rate regression parameters, and
data locations, adjustments if applied, units, and more.
\item \code{mean()}: calculates the mean of all converted rates, or those specified by
the \code{pos} input. e.g. \code{mean(x, pos = 1:5)} The mean can be exported as a
separate value by passing \code{export = TRUE}.
